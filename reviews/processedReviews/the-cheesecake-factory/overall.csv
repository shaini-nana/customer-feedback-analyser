"1|3|My rating still stands b/c the service even at limited capacity is super slow. However the host who greets you he is super nice and friendly. Our server is cool, but just doesn't seem happy to be at work, it's like he's here he present but you can't tell he would rather be elsewhere. The bread is usually warm but it came out cold, I asked for warm bread and I was told I have to wait for it to come out of the oven, I said that's fine, but have been waiting on it for a min now, so don't know if he forgot or what. Finally i had to ask another server for the bread. Then a few mins later our actual server came and was about to take my new bread and I had to stop him to say no that's new bread someone else brought me... As far as what I ordered was the buffalo cauliflower and brussel sprouts. However the brussel sprouts i feel were just a tad bit over cooked/roasted.Other than that everything was cool, just that the service was slow for it to be only at 35% capacity due to Covid."
"2|3|I love the Cheesecake Factory, I was so happy when they opened a location in Queens closer to home. I've dined at this location a couple of timespre-covid, service was terrible. Extremely slow! Not up to par with the Long Island location.Recently I ordered take out, and the experience was much better, food was packaged nicely. I would recommend for take out, if you want to dine in go to Westbury"
"3|1|This review is specifically for the cheesecake. So we decided on cheesecake for Thanksgiving dessert. The Dulce de Leche. (Caramel) cheesecake was delicious. I ordered two days prior. Its pricey but worth it for the quality and cheesecake lovers. When I went to pick it up, the restaurant was enforcing social distancing and masks. At minimum you must order two days prior. Must be kept frozen until about two hours prior to eating."
"4|2|This review has nothing to do with food. Food is amazing and order from her often. However I called at approximately 8:43 pm and they stated that there was an hour wait. I arrived at the restaurant at 9:00 am and was immediately told they closed down dining for the night. Fast forward 7 Minutes later, Andrew - who I assume is one of the mangers- allowed someone to be place on the list. This is unfair to customers who were just turned away from dining. They need to be more consistent with their practices."
"5|1|Not to be compared to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, or C&C Music Factory, or a Wedding Factory.Hot dang, this is all about the cheesecake! Get them all in my belly.I've never met a cheesecake here I didn't like. Oh, and their salads are like climbing a small mountain. The menu is like an encyclopedia of delicious. Carb counting? LMAO! Just open wide and enjoy the ride!"
"6|2|Update * I was told to contact Cheesecake Factory and never got a response I received an extremely extremely RAW steak here. Like omggggg. they made me a new one, but I didn't even feel satisfied with just a new meal. I should of gotten a free something for what I went through. My friends all finished there meals and then I got mine, ruined the whole night. The new steak didn't even taste good because it was rushed, wasn't seasoned at all. And I'm honestly not picky with steak. It didn't taste like my friends steak. The corn and mashed potatoes weren't even good. The corn had red peppers in it.  Just extremely disappointed.  I don't feel like they handled the raw meat Situation well either. The Cheesecake was good thought. They should just stick to being a dessert place."
7|1|First off JAZ was a great waiter. He did a wonderful job. He was insightful with the recommendations and knowledge of different foods and drinks that would please us and I loved that. The shrimp bistro was really good actually better than what I ordered and I would recommend that dish. Yes it was a Tuesday and it wasn't crowded but we were seated right away. And they did do temperature checks before we were seated. I would definitely visit this location again.
"8|2|The shepherds pie was drenched in Grease, I ordered two crab artichokes dip. And the cook was undercooked it taste like tuna!!!! Here we go again because I do like to venture into the cheesecake factory for my favorite crab artichoke dip. The problem with this particular franchise is that they seem to hire mediocre sous chefs. And the manager Andrew got  personal cause the crab dip was undercooked... it is not my first rodeo I tried to educate the manager Andrew because I understand it is his job but I've been going to the cheesecake factory for decades. I am very familiar with their menu. And he actually sat there and try to teach me. Ha ha funny!!! I hate to shit on places but if you love the cheesecake factory please don't go to that location because you're not gonna win with the mediocre staff that they hired that does not know their sheer history on excellent yummy food. It seems that sometimes these places just seem to follow the instructions instead of tasting their foods. And correcting it!!! I just simply wanted to return the food so he can taste both tuna dishes although he said it was crab. Take it from somebody that Is familiarized with menu and dishes!!! how do I know that the dish was under cook because I to cook.  It is not the first time that it's happened I've encountered this problem in another location and it was fixed. The manager tasted it and when you don't cook it correctly it does taste like tuna!!!!! So please Andrew my advice to you as a manager honestly is stop being so defensive and start tasting the food. Stop educating people about things that you don't even know how it taste.I took two bites out a way to make sure that I was tasting it correctly, had my daughter tasted which we ordered from door Dash but it's not door dash is issues because they didn't cook the food. So Andrew next time a customer is calling you letting you know that they know the menu better than you do although you work there now , how long have you been working there. Venture outside your store and try other cheesecake factories and try these dishes and you'll see that you guys in your location aren't making it right and if you're satisfied with crab that taste like tuna. Then go and work on the subways. But I know I didn't place an order for tuna!!! Again understand I love the cheesecake factory and although this venture turned out horrible it will be my last visit not to this location! And I'm definitely placing an order over the phone when the staff is sure that they are feeding their customers near mediocre shitty food. Thank you very much Andrew for your help you weren't much use. Stop being defensive and listen to your customer when somebody's telling you that taste like tuna and they placed two orders in your charging $30 I am not paying $30 fucking tuna and mayo."
"9|3|We did an order via DoorDash and it arrived before the estimated pick up time. When we were there, the staff ignored our inquiries about how and where to get my orders. After a 15-minute wait in the middle of restaurant without any idea of what I should do, there was finally a waiter asking our names on the order and helping me pick up. The food was decent with no surprise and was packed properly. Our favorite was stuffed mushroom which was well grilled and the sauce was addictive. As our expectation, food from Cheesecake Factory would not let you down but they definitely need to improve their service."
10|2|First of all I just want to say I'm appalled at the prices and portion. I ordered through door dash and I know they charge extra because of the fees. That's not the problem. I ordered string beans which was $6.95 and kid's chicken tenders both for my kid. The portion was not even a 1/3 filled up and the chicken tenders were so tiny and just really sad I had to order more food for my kid. You can see the portions in the pictures I provided. To make in even worse the bag was not sealed all they way. There was plenty of space in the middle of the bag for the dasher to take food. That is a major red flag during COVID. I am never gonna order from here ever again!
"11|2|I was a loyal diner with (Queens) Cheesecake Factory until October 9th. I ordered my normal meal with more than 10 year history. Evelyn pasta with no eggplant due to allergy. Cob salad with no avocado due to bad interaction with Warfarin. We got to our weekend home in Newport RI (4 hours) to our dismay to find our order was wrong eggplant and avocado was present in the meals. I called on that night and was asked to call in the morning.  I spoke to the manager and informed her that I would be ordering the same items on Sunday on my return to NYC. She stated that their policy was to let guests services handle these incidents. This is not a food ""did not like the meal"" but your staff ignored ""bringing allergies to our attention Policy"" which could have lead to hospitalization and lawsuits.  I asked could my order be remade on Sunday and I would bring back the Friday meal. No.  I was sent (2 weeks later) a $25 gift card for a more than $50 meal with cash tip.  I called and was told that in 10 years that I had complained 5 times and was flagged. I informed the manager that the Queens' CF should have been more do to the many issues that had been experienced there.  Bad service, long waits for cold food, recipe substitutions, and just below CF normal standards.  I got a call from Guest Services to assure me that I was not on a list. The food is not free and who cares about a list for poor service and poor attention to details.  I was appalled and was never offered the reimbursement for food that could not be eaten.  We were loyal to this restaurant and felt the slap in the face.  More than 10 years and 5 complaints would make a better restaurant try to make it right.  Cheesecake Factory was a colossal failure in customer services.  $10 dollars worth of ingredients to lose a more than a 20 year Copy of receipt:ELMHURST, NY90-15 Queens Boulevard, Elmhurst, NY 11373Queens Center(718) 699-1212Order # 871405263(Note: You do not needthis number to pickup)Customer Name: Wayne Customer Email: Customer Contact Number: Payment Method: Credit Card Mastercard ORDER FOR PICKUP Order ready at 4:07 PM, TODAY (FRIDAY, 10/9/2020)For Pickup orders, please see a staff member who will direct you where to pick up your order.1 x Oreo® Dream Extreme Cheesecake (1 x $9.50) = $9.50***WHIPPED CREAM ON THE SIDE. 1 x Add Vanilla Ice Cream(1 x $1.95) = $1.951 x Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (1 x $18.50) = $18.50CAROLYN ***EXTRA BROCCOLI.

"12|2|I came here for what i thought would be brief moment, but was mistaken. I came for a slice of dulce de leche cheesecake on Valentine's Day. Understandingly it was packed. I had about four people in front of me ordering. For one cheesecake, it took them 30-40 min. I left without checking the slice they gave me for $9 and got this tiny piece. I was shocked and disappointed. The young lady at the register was very nice, but i don't get how you can charge $9 and give such a small slice."
"13|1|It's beautiful and delicious! Simply the best of the bests ! The employees are friendly, the cleanliness seems good, staff wearing masks and I want to eat all their cakes."
"14|3|Chains are not my favorite but was pleasantly surprised during my visit at this location.After a disastrous family photo session at the mall, stopped here for some respite. Our six month old had just fallen asleep (praise Jesus!) so we needed a place where we could keep him napping in the stroller. The staff here were kind enough to oblige us and give us a quieter spot in the corner. Our stroller is relatively compact so we were allowed to keep it open - and the interior lighting was dim which was a plus for us.The waiter started us off with warm bread and kept our glasses refilled. While not entirely authentic, I had no major complaints about our chilaquiles and jambalaya hash from the weekend brunch menu. The jambalaya was the better of the two dishes and had some heat to it. The chilaquiles were a bit bland in comparison. Our waiter was friendly and attentive even while running between tables. While the food isn't wowful, the excellent service and the willingness of the staff to accommodate us had this tired mama leaving satisfied."
"15|1|This was my first time at this new location at Queens Center Mall. We were seated outdoor which felt amazing at first until the weather got warmer.  The screens were lowered to turn the AC, but never felt the AC until we were leaving. Our appetizer and main course arrived at the same time, which I hate when that happens at a restaurant. The food was eatable, but was lackluster in seasoning. They gave my sister the wrong pasta dish, the supervisor removed it from the bill and offered her another dish. The second dish was much better than the first one. My staple appetizer is always the avocado egg rolls, but at this location it was not that great. The avocado was not firm enough inside the egg roll. My spicy chicken sandwich wasn't spicy all at. I am huge a fan of the cheese cake factory, but this location didn't do it for me. The food was too bland. The only thing I had like was the lemonade it was sweet with a hint of tartness which made it so delicious and refreshing. The one in Garden City the food is always delicious and amazing."
"16|2|All i can say is poor service; 1 hour wait on sundayy night just for a table of 6 and an additional 25 minutes wait for staff  to take an order.  We were seated in a table that was not fully set, silverware missing and the server seemed lost without help from the bus boy.  Came to celebrate my niece bday at her request since she likes the food.  When appetizers were order and the bread was brought to the table we stIll had no plates, silverware and they forgot the butter. For a table oof six we got 5 pieces of bread??? We asked for bread, silverware, napkins  and water...Total disaster, place is so dark that when thE pork chops arrived we did not realized that they were partially cooked.  My mother in law had raw pork on her plate.  Manager and server were called over and they acted like no big deal. Did not come back to say anything else, the item was removed from the bill; overall poorly trained manager and hardly trained server along side fellow bus boy.  Will not come back to this location.  Floor area near bathrooms is slippery as it is the entrance to the open kitchen and grease is alll over the floor."
"17|1|The wait to get in is normally long but when I went here with my sister in the middle of the day ( a working day as well) we did not have to wait at all. The staff are very friendly and very attentive. The menu is extensive and has a little bit of everything from everywhere. I'm still not sure as to which region of the world they claim their menu is from. The place was clean and had a wonderful ""fancy"" atmosphere. The food came out fairly quickly. We ordered just apps as from previous experiences, the main entrees are HUGE! The appetizers were extremely delicious. We decided to share a slice of their chocolate Oreo cheesecake for dessert. It was a massive slice of cake that was very decadent and sweet. I don't know how one can finish a slice on his or her own. Not only is it huge, but very very sweet. The prices very also fairly reasonable."
"18|1|Went on Saturday night after shopping at the mall with my husband and two kids (2yrs and 9m old). We were seating immediately at a big booth, with a high chair on the end for my little one. Our server came over and introduced herself (I'm sorry I forgot her name but she was very nice). We put in the mini corn dogs for my 2 year old before anything else. The menu is huuuuge! It's a lot to look at so it took us a while to decide. When my son's food came we ordered our meals. We ordered the calamari which was so delicious. Very tender and not tough at all. The breading was the perfect texture, not too hard. I got the pasta carbonara and I forget the exact name of my husband's dish, but it was breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My pasta was creamy and flavorful. They could've gone a little lighter on the pepper but I loved it anyway. My husband's chicken was really yummy. The breading was very light and crisp. We also got a side of Mac n cheese and it's so good! The portions are very decent, so we took the rest of our meals to go. We also ordered two slice of cheesecake to go - the banana cream and Oreo. Those things got devoured so fast when we got home that I didn't even have time to take a picture lol. Absolutely delicious and we definitely want to try more. The waitress checked on us and offered us refills. Service was great. This was all of our first time trying this place and we were very pleased!"
19|3|The wait is very long but the service is good and so it the food must try their cheesecake my favorite it the strawberry cheesecake but they are all good.
"20|3|I usually enjoy a good meal at a Cheesecake Factory! I ordered a seared tuna salad which was delicious! No complaints on my food, my strawberry lemonade or the bread! Our server was friendly but could have been a bit more attentive since we were such a large party.The bathroom however needs some help. The women's restroom needed to be cleaned. The soap dispensers were broken. The restaurant provided bottles hand soap but it was so cheap that it didn't even sud! It was a no name brand soap that was red. Need to do better on this! Soap is imperative for hygiene of your staff and guests!The rest of the restaurant looked clean and the staff were all friendly."
"21|3|Came here for my best friends fathers birthday. We waited 20 minutes to be seated.  We ordered 3 entrees and an appetizer I had the stuffed mushrooms, my best friend had tomato basil pasta and her dad had the carne asada. We also shares tortilla with spinach dipS. We all enjoyed the food.. it did take a while for everything to come out but it did eventually.  Our server Jocelyn was very pleasant.  I told jocelyn about the birthday for my best friends dad and we awaited a surprise for him.  Service was very slow we finished our food and waited a while for the birthday dessert... and had to tell the server a second time... a second server because our first server went on break. We were literally sitting at our table on our phones. The coordination here is very poor and quite honestly there would be no wait if this place had everything together. Servers were great, food was good.. but we did wait a bit too long."
"22|2|I usually come here when my family gets a gift card. The best parts of the meal usually are the whole wheat bread and cheesecake. The waiters/waitresses are hospitable and nice but seem to rotate a lot... I've never seen a waiter or waitress on more than one visit. Recently we visited and had a 1 hour wait on a Saturday for table of 3. I usually get the bread for free with butter and both whole wheat and white bread. Maybe it was because the waitress was new and was not trained well, but we did not get the bread until we asked for it, and there was no whole wheat bread at all... and it was cold and hard. Even the table next to us had both breads. We had pork belly sliders which were hot and delicious. I believe it had a sweet barbecue sauce. We also had the filet mignon which was standard and the evelyns favorite pasta that was recommended by the waitress. There was a problem with my tuna poke dish for some reason. It had to come a little later than the other dishes. So it took like 35 minutes after the appetizer (sliders) came. I believe it was a manager who came to apologize to us and explain that I will get a free salad or soup to make up for the wait. It seemed like it was optional though because the waitress came back 2 minutes after dropping off my tuna poke and asked if I still wanted the salad or soup. Of course I did. I came here several times and had such issues from the kitchen at least on 3 different visits... I'm not sure what's going on but maybe they need more staff in the kitchen/better system in place."
"23|2|The customer service here has never really been an issue, but after today I would never go back.  Amidst eating my Sheila's cashew chicken salad, I saw a bug upside down.  When I moved it to see what it was, I saw it was a ladybug.  I am so disgusted that I am at a loss for words!  For the times that we are in, and the prices at restaurants, they should really inspect their kitchens.  This was truly a horrible and disgusting experience."
"24|1|I love the cheese cake factory it is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. And the one in Miami beach.when I went to this location it was nice the atmosphere was cool and the staff was nice. I had gotten a couple of pieces of cake ,the chocolate cheese cake and a strawberry cheesecake. Along with a regular piece of cheese cake,and I can say I enjoyed it.I would definitely go back ,I recommend it when in queens nyc stop by for some cake or some good food"
25|2|The food was horrible!! I had ribeye steak and mash potatoes . The mash was not creamy but was like play doh and my steak was hard . $45 for garbage . Do not go here post covid they must have a new chef this experience was by far the worst ever .
"26|1|I absolutely love this Cheesecake Factory. The only downfall of this location is that is located in queens center mall so you have to pay to park and walk through the mall to get to the restaurant. The service is quick and employees are friendly and welcoming.I came here on a Saturday afternoon and have a skinnilicious salad and crab bites. They have a entire skinnylicious menu which is nice if you are trying to watch calories or such. Prices are pretty good! About $11 for a cesear salad and 7 for crab bites. Let me tell you these crab bites were sooo good that we ordered a second order to take home for later. It was paid with a garlic mayo sauce and I wanted to take a jar of it home if I could. Salad was also delicious and wasn't so heavy that I was terribly full all day. There is free refills on soft beverages.Our servers name was Anthony and for how big the location is he was great and quick. Was around to bring us bread, take our order, and refill our beverages very efficiently and quickly. Decor inside is beautiful and this afternoon we actually sat on the patio side where windows can raise to make it feel you are sitting outside. It was raining the day we went so windows were closed.Especially weekend nights, you can wait long time for a table and they do not take reservations. But if you have to wait it is still worth it. Anything and everything I have tried at this location is great and it is definelty a great place to check out!"
"27|2|Service sucks! After sharing my concerns with the MANAGER: ANDREW - he said: I'm sorry and didn't try to offer anything in return. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! When I arrived, I sat at an empty bar for 10 min before anyone even acknowledged me. And come to find out that - the ""Hispanic"" women who FAILED to acknowledge my presence WAS in fact A MANAGER! I was then taken care of by a black bartender, who was ok with his service, but not on top of it enough to get tipped generously. He gave me my check before I asked for it and was eating fries on the side, while I was sitting...waiting for him to take my card, in order to pay. Backing up, my LETTUCE WRAPS took waaaaaaayyyyy too long to come out and the glasses that I sampled wine in - were DIRTY! The BEST thing about my experience was the S'mores Cheesecake! I'm mad that I even left a tip!"
"28|1|This is one of the best CCF in the NYC area. What they lack in speed, they make up for with service and quality.  Our server, Ariana, was super friendly and personable.I ordered the tomato basil chicken pasta in the Carle Place location and though it tasted good, it was dry and less seasoned. This location? The opposite!  It was well seasoned and even had olive oil with basil sprinkled about the dish.  We tried mojitos, a pineapple & a passionfruit, and they so were tasty, but expensive for the location at $12.75.  I was soooo full, and still had to pack half of my dinner to go (was even better the next day).  We've only had cheesecake here before, but I'm certainly glad we stayed for dinner."
"29|1|I love the cheesecake factoryYou have the option for healthy food, or no that healthy, portions are big, so u can even share. I love a salad that has like an Asian dressing . For dessert, my 2 to go are key lime and macadamia nut one. Good cocktails too.Enjoy!!"
30|1|I personally love cheesecake factory. This month theyre doing a limited edition collaboration with Cinnabon. The cake has a minimal cinnamon taste (not too powerful) and some crunchy bits thats soooo good in the middle with cheesecake. UGH to devour for IG: @eatsumbapWe also ordered the chicken riesling which had a generous amount of meat and the best aldente noodles. YUMLastly we ordered the chicken pot pie which was actually deliever on a dish with the filling at the bottom topped with mash potatoes (not the usually potpie you picture)  They were all generally good. The potpie was slightly salty for my tasting but all the food we order from here always makes me happy.
"31|3|Walking by some kids on the street today. Guess what they are shouting?  ""ooh.... Cheesecake Factory,"" apparently, I am not the only one who has a liking for cheesecakes!I avoid the sit-down area because it's always crowded by the Queens Center Mall and not worth the wait for dessert only.  Since it's Easter today, it's already packed at 5:30PM. Have some patience since the take out person handles several tasks.  Kudos to the female cashier for serving us (the order to go customers), the ringing phones, and pick up orders.  Picked up a slice of white chocolate caramel macadamia nut.  Always forget how sweet it is and stop after eating half.  The fresh cream is always a treat.Many choices of cakes and cheesecakes to choose from.  Happy Easter!"
"32|1|This review is solely based on the food. The service by the waiters are ALWAYS A+. The stewardess needs a lesson on hospatality. E.g I asked for a table for 2 and was told 50mins. My girlfriend comes in 15 mins later and she is told 30 mins wait for a table for 2. Why not direct the parties of two or less to the bar for seating? That would be way too easy. Smh!On to the food. The waiter Ken was so helpful with what I was crazing, firecracker salmon appetizer it was an amazing choice. I also added the passion fruit mojito and a single serving ceasar salad. Everything was to my liking.With all that being said please go and risk a long wait or seating by close to the bar. (Bar seating is table seating too. You're seating high table bar style)"
"33|3|On this here 1st day of 2019 after a late night of celebrating no one wanted to cook. So we venture out. I was super particular in what I wanted becuase I had it the week before at the other cheesecake factory location, cheeseburger egg rolls and fried cheese (Don't judge my life).  So the diner that my companion  was heading to was vetoed. It's the cheesecake factory, one the finer chain spots to some. The one that always seems to have a crazy wait no matter what state you're in. Luckily  we were able to snag a high top bar table as soon as we got there. Ordered coffee, because its life.Why the 3 stars, becuase they didnt have my fried cheese... boooooooo... or the Cuban sandwich that my partner wanted...booooooo to the second power. I dont get why that happens. I get it, but when your mouth is ready for fried cheese...it's ready for fried cheese. So instead of the sandwich, the smokehouse burger was order and Nashville nuggets replaced the fried cheese. It was all tasty... its cheesecake factory; consistent. I will give 5 stars to our waiter... the awesomest!"
34|1|[COVID pick up order] Everything was ready at the time stated and the food was delicious. I recommend the jerk chicken and shrimp! Yummy! and of course any and all the cheesecakes! but i got the caramel cheesecake with EXTRA WHIP CREAM. :) yummy!!! my kids loved it!
"35|3|3.5 stars Ok I was done, but we received a lot of gift certificates so we didn't have much of a choice but to come back. We arrived in time for Happy Hour and we got the last 2 seats at a table. Seriously no wait for us on a Friday evening?? The place was packed. Still confused why it's so popular...last time we were here the food sucked. It was so heavy and salty. This time, the food was much better but we didn't order much since we ate a late lunch. For drinks, we started with a Long Island Iced Tea and a Mojito. They were kinda weak, so next round we asked for stronger Long Islands and the bartender made it right. Our server, Brian, was great. We were given bread as we waited for our appetizers. The bread was warm and even the butter was melted. I love spinach dip and their version kinda tastes like creamed spinach at a steakhouse. Really oily though...chips were a bit too thick. Pico de Gallo was very fresh. Also had their corn tamales. Better than last time. It was very sweet but at least it wasn't too salty. Ingredients tasted much fresher than the last time I was here. Sharing 2 appetizers was enough to fill me up I didn't need dinner that night. I'll be be back soon for HH!"
36|2|I paid almost $8 for a slice of cheesecake tHat looks like this. What a rip off. Very poor quality conUpdate: looking for answers rather than being told to reach out for the second time by giving me directions to your website.
"37|2|I went there with my friend today. Food was good but i wanna talk about service.We didnt get spoons and forks even after the foods were served. The server didnt notice until we ask. People next to us had same situation. We waited at the front to be seated, but the table wasnt ready. Funny and surprising service ever."
"38|1|I had no idea Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant and not a dessert place. I didn't get a memo! My friend and I decided to meet for lunch somewhere around the Queens Mall. We don't know the area well but found this restaurant inside the mall. The reviews were not that great but I just had to try it myself, especially when they serve food and not just the cheesecake. It's a beautiful restaurant. We both ordered fish tacos. It came with rice and beans. The fish taco was quite good. The beans was pretty good too. I would like to come back with Hubby and order this fish tacos when I feel like having it. I think he would like it too. My friend said she knows about the Cheesecake Factory but never crossed her mind to try it. Our waiter, James(?), was pretty helpful with our orders. I don't know about other dishes but the fish tacos was quite amazing. The fish was fresh. The seasoning was just perfect, not too overpowering, very nice fish tacos!"
"39|1|Visited here yesterday. Great food! I had the Tex-Mex egg rolls as an appetizer, my fave entree (the Tuscan chicken meal minus the capers), and a Cinnabon cheesecake for dessert. Delicious!"
"40|1|I love the cheesecake factory. They always find a way to fill me up. I hate it when I'm handed a menu, and I look through it, figure out what I want, then told they ran out. It's frustrating. I wish they just told me when they handed me the menu lol"
"41|1|I'm always a fan of Cheesecake Factory. They have great salads. Like their factory burrito, fish tacos and oreo cheesecake among other items."
"42|3|I rarely eat at chain restaurants but my teen boys wanted to come here in celebration of one of their birthdays. I will say that we all left super stuffed and had to take doggy bags to take away. My boys both had fried Mac and cheese appetizers which are fried into little balls that resemble slight large munchkins from Dunkin' donuts. Us adults shared the spinach dip app and we all ended up getting burgers. The burgers were not bad at all for a chain restaurant. I couldn't finish mine but it was good, I ended up with the Mac and cheese burger which was a bit disappointingly executed. They basically just put one of the fried Mac & cheese balls on your burgers. I was expecting a burger smothered in creamy dripping Mac and cheese. Still tasted decent but I probably wouldn't go back there unless it's my kid's request. Unfortunately I didn't have space to even think about cheesecake so there's that. Maybe next time I'm in the mall, I'll stop in and pick one up to take home and try out."
"43|1|I don't often do chain restaurants but there is something I really like about the Cheesecake Factory perhaps, it's the plethora of desserts, noooo the food is pretty decent too, and usually the dishes are so grand that you will have leftover for lunch the next day. You definitely will get your monies worth. This time we arrived during happy hour, oh what a way to unwind with half price apps and delicious cocktails. I believe happy hour is from 4-7 don't quote me on the exact time. My husband and I were actually hungry so we kept our appetizer basic. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread that was paired with seasoned olive oil and marinara sauce. It had a  perfect crunchy yet chewy texture. We had cocktails as well, the cosmopolitan here is on point so is the mojito. Shout out to whoever is the mixologist. Following our dishes arrival, my husband had the taco meal that was accompanied by rice and beans. I had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken and I swapped out the angel hair pasta for linguini. It was not bad it was a mixed linguini, I believe It was a basil mixture. The staff is attentive and sweet. We were so full, we opted out of dessert. Now that's crazy, no cheesecake, maybe next time cheesecake to go."
"44|3|The atmosphere was nice and the server was very good buy the quality of the food was not so good. I order a strawberry short cake they gave me some biscuit type of things with ice cream and cute up strawberries it was not good, I would not recommend this it. But the pizza chicken Parmesan was good."
"45|2|Lackluster again. I honestly don't know what's going on here, but corporate needs to look in to this place. Of all the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to, this is by far the worst. Everybody has a smart mouth and attitude problem. I asked for another table because the table was wobbly and the hostess gave an attitude and deep sigh. Excuse me ma'am, but relax. This is your job. Again, water and bread took forever to get there. Actually it came right before my apps which was about an overall 40 minute wait from being sat to it being in my table. 40 mins without water while ppl that were sat after me received their entrees and second drinks. I did however notice some ppl next to me that were upset about not being offered any bread either and saying that's the main reason they come in here is for the bread. Asked for a manager and was told they'll be here shortly. Waited 10 mins then left a $20 under my plate and exited, didn't even ask for a bill. Anyways, 0 for 2 at this location. I'll stick to the one by Roosevelt Field. Anybody that does dine here, may the odds ever be in your favor."
"46|1|30mins waiting for table ,20mins waiting for food ,15mins finish the food ,but they got best cheesecake in the world"
"47|2|This is only my second visit to any Cheesecake Factory. I found overall the apps to be the tastiest and the entrees to be sorely disappointing and flavorless.Service was friendly, but it took 2+ hours for 2 apps, 1 soup, 2 entrees and 1 dessert to come out! Yikes, who has that kind of time? And that was with us ordering everything all at once. One thing that did bother me was we ordered a soup. When served the soup we were told they were missing 2 toppings of the soup.... so why would you still serve it to us? Or at least take it off the bill. It's not a loaded potato soup when there's no cheese or scallions on it. The 2 small plates were great (zucchini sticks and mushrooms), but the angel hair shrimp  entree was flavorless, lots of salt had to be added. And pasta was over cooked. My chicken bellageio was okay, but a tad dry and oily. The restaurant I thought had a strange musky/wet smell. It was darkly lit and very loud as to be expected. Great server, slow food executions and bland food."
48|1|I like that there's finally a Cheesecake Factory in NYC that is fairly easy to get to. It's in a prime location. The wait was not long to get a table and the waiters were fairly friendly. The fish tacos dish is now my favorite dish. My friend had the Mac and cheese burger and she loved it. Their dishes are not that clean and the waitress seemed to be in a hurry to get us out. The bathrooms were clean and they smelled good. Most importantly the Cheesecake was the best. I recommend everyone try the red velvet cheese once.
"49|2|We walked in and we were seated right away. Usually the start of great service right? Wrong! A waitress came to us and informed us that our real server was off the floor and she's be assisting us until our real server returned back to the floor. No big deal right? Everyone deserves a break. However, when the waitress asked for our drink orders my friend had said just a water and then she completely ignored my drink order! The waitress walked away without taking my drink order! Completely rude! When she came back I asked for a drink. When she came back with my drink she took our orders, and then asked if we wanted bread for the table. We said yes. Our real server comes back at this point, 10 minutes later, we have no food, just drinks and she asks us if everything's Ok. No, lady it's not. We were promised bread for the table and it hasn't arrived. The 1st waitress comes back and tells us our food will be out shortly. Okay, why do we have two servers trying to serve this table? Once our food arrives, it was hot. Which I was happy about, with the lack of service and the confusion between staff I was worried our food would have been cold I would have been angry. But the real topper is, I'm a new mom, and it was my FIRST outing with my new baby. I wanted to sit in a booth, and have my child next to me in the stroller, one of the women from the front desk comes over to us as were eating and tells me I can't have the stroller next to me because it's a fire hazard, that's why she removed the chair. How is this a fire hazard? It's only me! And on top of that there's no one else seated around us! The place was quiet! I have a newborn with me as a new mom. I wanted her next to me. The girl at the front desk was rude about it too. She could have said it in a nicer way. And why would you wait to say something when we're halfway through eating our meal? At that point you could have just let it slide. The place was slow at that point anyway! My friend ended up giving them a tip anyway for horrendous service and rude workers. I would not have given a tip if that was me. I would have just paid my bill and left. I should have spoken with a manager at this point, but I just wanted to get the hell out of here. Needless to say, I will NOT come back here again. First time out as a new mom, first time to this location to eat and do some Christmas shopping and this is my experience? No thanks. I'd pass if I were you, there are plenty of other places to eat around there. If I could give zero stars for the service I would."
"50|2|Sorry is not enough, I paid $148 plus tips above %20and it was my 30th anniversary, very disappointing sir"
"51|2|This place is a nightmare. Everything that you hope a restaurant isn't, is Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure if the other locations are this bad, but the service here was horrible enough our party had to leave after we were seated. I could not imagine food tasting anything near okay with such horrid service. We definitely lost our appetite. We waited less than 30 min for a table for 4 people on a holiday Monday night, which isn't bad...except the servers here aren't servers at all. The only thing they know how to do is walk around with an apron pretending to be busy. They don't greet, are either rude or expressionless, do not ask if they can bring you anything, avoid eye contact, etc. The people up front that hand out buzzers and walk you to your table at least acknowledge that you exist. Our server brought us bread after 15 min... no knives, no water, just walked away ignoring us. We had one person on the way about to walk in and our server almost kicked us out for not having everyone there. Honestly wanted to avoid this location when I saw that it was rated less than 2 stars, but I wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Bad idea. Will not be coming back here, ever. Going to any fast food place in the qcm food court is better than this Cheesecake Factory. We went to red lobster instead and everything was amazing as always. My advice would be to avoid Cheesecake Factory altogether and just go to Red lobster. They never disappoint. I ended up tipping our waiter there a very generous amount. I have no idea what the people here are being paid to do; you get better waiting service from a deli.I don't think they even deserve my one star."
"52|3|Oh dear. Let me begin by saying that the cheesecake itself (which is all we came in for BTW) was delicious. Service however, definitely left a lot to be desired. And thats not by any means saying that it was very bad but it was a very quiet Monday night and there seemed to be ample enough staff on shift but our server was nowhere to be found for most of our time there and she still forgot to bring out one of our orders of cheesecake despite us not really ordering much and the slow pace of the night"
"53|2|Had a poor experience at the restaurant in Elmhurst, NY location. Pasta was overcooked to the point in was inedible. Had to wait another 20mins+ for it to be recooked. Rest of my party was finished with their meals well before I received my new meal. Server said manager would come speak to me about my experience but never came. Then only after leaving feedback about my experience on the website, the manager said he would help make the next experience right. Had to keep following with the manager, at least two times. But  manager didn't do what he said he was going to do. If you say you're going to make it right than do it, otherwise don't offer it. I shouldn't have to keep chasing you.First and last time visiting this location. Promise and Don't Deliver seems to be the motto of the management of this location.What a horrible guest experience at Cheescake factory all around!"
54|1|The Cheesecake Factory is just as great as it has always been. I came back and got the Hershey Cheesecake this time and it was dynamite. I also tried the Mac n cheese burger which was really juicy and definitely had a ton of flavor. All of the sides were perfect as well. The server was courteous and punctual so we always got the next drink right away. The location was clean and there is not a single thing I would change about the experience.
"55|1|If was our first time of visiting Cheesecake factory, but I liked it! Great choice of american food, burgers, pizza, pasta and of course cheesecakes (my love :)), maybe around 20 types of all tastes. Prices are nice and atmosphere is very beautiful. The only thing is that it was very crowded and it took some time to serve us, but I do understand it because it was saturday 6 pm. The host tell us it would take 30 min to wait, but we waited only 10-15 min. Definitely recommend, especially not at busy hours."
"56|3|Three of us stopped into Cheesecake Factory Saturday to celebrate a birthday. The wait time was normal, about 45 minutes. Once seated, we had a unusually long wait for any type of service. I would say about 15 minutes before our order was taken, and an extra 10 before we even got water. We ordered two drinks from the bar at the same time, one arrived on-time, the other arrived half way through our mains. The bread didn't make it to the table until we finished our apps and bread refill made it just as we were finishing out mains (kept being told that it was in the oven)We started our meal with Avocado Eggrolls and Dynamite Shrimp. Both were okay, but cold and soggy. This didn't really effect the eggrolls, but the shrimp were a bit rubbery and falling apart. The presentation of both were also very depressing and nothing like it used to be.For our main, all entrées were very tasty, however; the Miso Salmon didn't arrive until about 15 minutes after the other two plates were delivered; when the other two people were nearly finished with their meals. The excuse as to why it took so long to come out: it had to be remade because we requested the vegetable to be changed to asparagus after the order was placed (which was only 4 pieces around the side of the plate). In addition to the entrée problem, we requested water refills. It never came, so I got up and served our table water from the station because our waiter was nowhere to be found. By the time dessert came around, we were already aggravated and ready to leave, so we decided to take it to-go.I normally don't say anything, but leaving disappointed, with a poor taste, after spending $145 (before tip) is not something I like doing. To me, I used to love coming to Cheesecake Factory because of the fresh, high quality food, nice presentations and affordable pricing. Now it seems like many corners are trying to be cut to and the normal standard is not being met. I am sorry to say, but this, the overall service and the meal will likely sway us not to come back to this store, especially on a weekend.P.S. Finding out that my favorite cheesecake was discontinued, Chris's Outrageous, let me down even further."
"57|2|Just because this Cheesecake Factory restaurant is in the mall doesn't mean the quality has to go down as well. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in other areas and by far this is the worst one. The servers are poorly trained. Our server didn't seem enthusiastic at all and it did reflect on the tip as well. I tip all the time, more than the average customer; however our server disappeared. I had to get up from my seat and search for him. He kept telling us on a slow business weekday our drinks were backed up. Another server had to come to assist us. The teriyaki chicken was very rubbery. I am also not the person to complain about food also.  I dislike throwing food out. The chicken was cheap quality chicken. Your better off eating chicken teriyaki chicken or any other foods in the mall for only $10. I've been to 3rd world countries and I've had much better service along with food. We had also overheard another table that complained as well saying the service was terrible. We waited so long for our drinks and we were being rushed which didn't sit well with myself and my colleagues. We decided to visit Cheesecake thinking it would be a great experience. I didn't want nothing to do with this place after this experience. We decided to pay the food and cancel the drinks. PLEASE be warned! READ the reviews before entering this establishment. I am utterly astonished to how many people working in the restaurant the service would be so bad. Your better off visiting a regular diner where servers give their absolute best. Please look at the photo on the quality of the chicken. It's burned rather than charred. Enter at your own risk. You've been WARNED!! Cheesecake Factory is a revolving door for workers . The employees aren't happy and it sure did show the server who ""attempted to serve us"""
"58|3|Was in with large group from work about 8 pm. 1st told 45 minutes for table of 9,  2 minutes later we were seated at a table after splitting up or party and sitting in bar. Hmmm. Waitress was good although she had a lot of tables to take care of. Food was solid but nothing exceptional. Seemed fairly clean although bathroom was bit messy and tired. Just a familiar place."
"59|2|As a Californian I grew up with Cheesecake factory. I took a friend who had never been. Firstly everything was very slow. We waited nearly 1/2 an hour for bread. We asked for a top up on bread and proceeded to wait another 40 minutes for bread and our check. Our waiter disappeared and a new waiter began serving us. The bread didn't ever come and we were just sitting unattended. My friend let them know it was my birthday and they never came and we eventually told them to forget it. This also definitely caused some G.I./stomach upset as well. I was too scared to eat my leftovers, I was originally so excited for. I read others experienced diarrhea. I wish I had looked at the reviews first. I didn't eat anything else that day so I'm pretty sure this food was the culprit."
60|1|The restaurant provided the reliable good service and food expected of the CCF. Staff were welcoming and very attentive. The food was delicious and well worth a visit. The place was very well priced. We came here first time on my friend birthday and today we came again THANK YOU so much CHEESECAKE FACTORY
61|2|I cant understand there is always a problem in this place. I saw cockroaches on my last visit and stopped going there. I came there  today feb 6 at 10 pm. Was served in dirty  plate manager said did you try rubbing it off  and explains hid dishwasher. I showed him it was dirt and he said may be from my jacket. Then he rubs the plate and says yes you were right it is dirt do you want same dish.  I got mad at this point and left hungry.
"62|2|Yesterday I traveled from Brooklyn to Queens to give the Cheesecake Factory some much needed business. A friend of mine has been feeling low with the pandemic and figured I would pick up cheesecake to lift his spirits. I wanted the 30th anniversary cheesecake but was informed they were no longer selling it. I couldn't decide between the Godiva and the Chocolate Mousse and the employee at the counter convinced me to go with the lighter chocolate mousse. My friend was very happy to see a piece of cheesecake and started on it almost immediately. Unfortunately, the taste was out of balance and the texture had gone off. Perhaps sales are way down and cakes are staying around too long. A separate issue was the piece given was only a sliver of all the previous slices I have picked up in the past. What was meant as a pick--me-up for a a friend turned out to be more bad news. A disappointing trip."
"63|2|Came here tonight for a celebration dinner. Upon walking in the place looked huge and well done, but the seating(booth) and broken tables became a dead give away that this Cheesecake Factory will be a disappointment.We were quickly seated by one of the nicest waiter who quickly bought some water and bread for us. After spending 5-10mins browsing through the menu, we decided on:1. Beetroot goat cheese salad2. Guacamole and chips 3. Factory meatloaf 4. Seared ani tunaPros: Beetroot and goat cheese salad was amazing Cons: 1. Old chips, guacamole was poorly seasoned 2. Meatloaf had sauce that tasted super artificial and was extremely sweet3. Ani tuna was a complete scam! I got served 5 pieces of see through tuna placed on top of 2 cups of brown rice for $21!! If your out of tuna then do not say you have it. Those 5 pieces added together equals to one slice of tuna sashimi Overall this place did not meet my expectations at all. The one in Long Island is much better, great service, and properly prepared food!"
"64|2|As with all other Cheesecake Factories, the food is great, especially their  selection of cheesecakes, but I don't enjoy coming to this location.The crowded mall area, the parking situation, the unfriendly staff, and extremely slow service might make you want to think twice about coming here.Oh, forgot to mention, the constant police presence across the street and having to watch people placed under arrest right before you enter the restaurant is an added bonus."
"65|3|While I always enjoy the food at The Cheesecake Factory, I don't particularly like this location. It's a restaurant attached to Queens Center Mall and while the traffic when this location first opened was ridiculous (I'm talking waiting time for HOURS), the wait doesn't seem very long now. I came here to have dinner on Sunday night and was shocked at how small the place was! I mean.. it was definitely the smallest Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. We wanted a booth so the wait was around 20 minutes, though I definitely felt like we waited longer than that. High seats were available immediately and that section was largely empty. There's a small couch outside that constitutes as a waiting area, but otherwise everyone just stands around with their little beeper waiting to be called up.Our waitress was friendly but she wasn't very attentive. She did come to refill our waters every now and then but we mostly had to call her over. She told us an appetizer would take 4 additional minutes to come out but we waited about 15 until another waitress brought it over and apologized. People come to celebrate their birthdays often, I believe you get a complimentary slice of cheesecake when you celebrate here.. but you'll hear them singing that quite often. They weren't very cheerful about it and seemed tired/unhappy. It definitely does not make you feel very special.I recommend the avocado eggrolls (these are amazing!!) and the crab artichoke dip. The salmon firecrackers were also pretty good. I enjoy the appetizers here a lot, and two appetizers is as filling as an entree for me! My friend got a hibachi steak and asked for it medium rare but it definitely came out well done. Overall, the food here is pretty good and the portions are EXTREMELY HUGE making the food here relatively affordable, however when I think of the Cheesecake Factory I imagine(d) a better experience than I had here. You almost feel like you're eating at Applebees at this location, if that makes any sense."
66|1|I would definitely be back for happy hour and my food is delicious. Servers where very friendly and accommodating. Very clean and spacious and comfortable. I
"67|1|I'm a little biased, the kids enjoyed the place hence the 4 stars, for grownups dessert can be a treat but it's guilty dining, will be back for the fudge sundae"
68|1|If your looking for a good quality service and good quality food with big serving and affordable. This is the best place for you. Great atmosphere and amazing variety of delicious food!!! If you have never been here then you should definitely try it out!!
69|2|The most terrible Cheesecake Factory I have ever been made me wait 2 hours to be seated when they told me 1 hour.Spaghetti wasn't even cooked it was row! When I called manager and asked him will he eat that. He replied Never!
"70|3|I'm not the type to go to a restaurant during its opening week. Everything is hectic and crazy. All that can be avoided by going a month or two later. Being my sister works there, me and a friend decided to stop by. In a sentence I can say, it was crazy. We came in an 5 pm on Friday and was told that a table would be free in an hour and that we should come back. After the hour we come back and we're given a pager. When it vibrates that means a table is ready. We waited over an hour and half! We finally get a table and it was so hectic. The servers were all over the place. My friend got the wrong dish and had to wait over 45 mins to get her correct dish. Apparently that qualifies for a discounted price or a free dish?????? I always try not to give the wait staff a hard time but with all the waiting we did and to have the wrong dish served to us I guess I should have asked for something. The food.......well I guess you can't have really high standards for chain restaurants. I paid $11 for 5 dumplings. That is outrageous anywhere. But of we hadn't ordered the appetizer we would have been sitting there without any food for an hour. At one point one of the 10 waiters I had asked if I wanted bread? Yes after 30 mins of nothing we'd like some bread. The pasta wasn't spicy. Creamy and mild. I guess the food is catered to American tastes. The CHEESECAKE. That was definitely the highlight and worth every bit of the hype it gets. It was so creamy and decadent. Everyone should experience the Cheesecake that is offered here.Overall I'd say wait till the hype dies down a bit. Everyone is frazzled and crazy. Also those prices are crazy. Lunch special ends at 5 pm. And the prices are half! If you can, come before 5. You'd definitely save some money and hopefully avoid the crazy crowd."
"71|1|Time to update my review for Cheesecake Factory. I always said when I die sprinkle my ashes over Cheesecake Factory. I changed my mind. I decided on a Green Burial instead. I'm digressing! First: Going to Sunday Brunch was on our bucket list for years. I'm certainly glad they decided to offer it on Saturday too. Not that a weekend trip either day to this mall is enjoyable. The train ride is always over an hour these days. That being said, my daughter is happy she can have the brunch menu at Lunchtime. I'll stick with the lunch menu. Brunch is 10-2 Saturday and Sunday now. Second: Service has greatly improved. We were greeted at the reception by a lovely young lady with a beautiful smile on her face. After quickly being escorted to our table, within minutes our server was at our ready. She also was lovely and smiling in addition to friendly. I finally felt welcome and at home at this location like I had at other locations! I think they finally got the CCF vibe down on their customer service!Third: Food preparation was timely. The food came out hot and portions are huge as always. I am always on the hunt for a decent pancake. Forget CCF on that one. I really wolfed them down. Some bites were light and fluffy while others were thick and heavy. I didn't know it was poor blending of the Ricotta into the batter until my Yelp Friend told me. Oh well. I'm not lowering my stars this review because I was the one that made poor food and drink choices this visit!  I'll know better next time! My daughter was really pleased with her meal. Naturally she had enough to take half home. She has self control that I lack!! She had Chicken and Waffles. She said the Chicken and the Waffles has a very nice taste. The potatoes were just the way she likes them. Drinks rated poor on my daughter's side. She didn't like her ice tea. She said it was weak. I made another poor choice. I had a Strawberry Smoothie. I thought I had gotten it before. I may have had a Strawberry Frozen Daiquiri without liquor. This smoothie was more like having desert. Very filling. I couldn't get cheesecake after that. I wasn't in the mood to take it home. Maybe if my daughter had split her piece. Fat chance! Finally: They do have good perks some times. We had a coupon from our last visit good for a free piece of cheesecake when you spend $30. My daughter wanted to try what I had last visit. She got Coffee and Cream Chocolate Supreme to go. With her will power she'll eat it a little every day all week. I need to learn to be that good! Conclusion and recommendations: They are getting their act together at this CCF location. The food preparation is still hit or miss. I've missed out two out of three meals so far. Remember my burnt Cuban Sandwich? I'm going to keep going. Maybe no more frequently than once a month. Preferably on a weekday for lunch! If you're as big a fan of their cheesecake as I am, you will enjoy. I'm really there for the cheesecake! And a word of warning: Don't look at the calories on the different cheesecake flavors. Forget any of the regular menu items calories too for that matter! I may stick with the Skinnylicious Menu now."
"72|2|Came here for dinner and I was not pleased at all. I am a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory, however after visiting this location I no longer will be a regular. I ordered a martini and instead they made a bellini. I sent it back and the bartender said that was a martini....when it obviously was not. Secondly, I ordered tacos which never came until I asked someone an hour later about it. The tacos were cold and I did not eat it. The service was horrible and I will not be returning."
"73|1|Hello this Cheesecake Factory is out of the way for me but I had to try it. It's in the queens mall and there is a huge parking lot with lots of levels. Walk in the big doors and it's a very nice looking restaurant like all of them and it's very large. We got booth seats instantly around 1:30 - 2pm. The place was clean when we went and we sat close to the cheesecake station, lol. But before cheesecake we orders Cajun shrimp pastas, crab it's were awesome and the pot stickers are tasty. Then I had the strawberry cheesecake and it was rockin. The food is pricey but they have a big selection of food to choose from and nice comfy booth seats and lighting."
"74|1|They can do no wrong, I love cheesecake and with all their flavor combos (tiramisu cheesecake is my favorite) how can I hate this place. Their food (beyond burger and tamales) and drinks are solid as well."
"75|1|The food was good. The cheesecake its the best! The only thing its that the location, if you park inside the mall you have to pay (and the waitting time at the restauran could be long) and its a lil hard to find parking at the street."
"76|1|I've been here several times with my boyfriend. We always enjoy it. The menu is literally 18 pages long with tons of options. My go to is the herb crusted salmon, it's one of my favorites. I also love the burgers, they have like 15 different variations. As for the service, it could be better."
"77|1|Just had a feeling of eating something disgusting, and getting all my calories for the day in one meal so came to the cheesecake factory. We had to wait an hour, but we just wandered around the mall for a bit before coming back. Pretty standard cheesecake factory fare here. The bread was warm and amazing. Beers are ~$7 here. We got the spinach and crab dip, and it was delicious. I ended up getting the truffle honey fried chicken. Very moist and had a great flavor. The thing that separates this from the other cheesecake factories is the service. I came here twice and both times I was greeted with exceptional kindness. Our drinks were never empty, and we were always checked up on."
"78|1|This rating is just for the Chinese Chicken Salad and White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake, and great service at the take-out counter (10/8/2019 about 7:15 pm). The cashier was pleasant, and actually checked the order for accuracy. Can't ask for anything more than that."
"79|1|This is my second visit to this location and we had an enjoyable dinner. Our wait was only 15 minutes for a table to 2, the day before Christmas eve-very surprising. Our waitress was attentive and our food arrived in a timely manner. I order the chicken enchiladas which tasted good, while my fiance order the Jamaican shrimp which also tasted good. Unfortunately we couldn't order any calamari being they were out. Overall it was a good experience."
"80|3|This place opened last year near me. Decided to finally try this place since I had never been to one. The menu is very large and is basically a mix of American, Mexican and Asian inspired dishes - stuff like grilled steak tacos, thai coconut-lime chicken, and eggplant parmesan. All in all, it is not much different in variety or quality than you would find in other big chains like Applebee's or Friendly's. The two big positives I would give Cheesecake is that they have a much nicer atmosphere. They are super clean, have super high ceilings and spacious seating with booths. The portions of the food are very large as well too."
"81|1|Went here August 2,2017 with my cousin,we went in as soon as they opened I had a cheeseburger and fries,it was the best burger I ever had and the drink was nice and strong we went to the bartender to ask her when is her hours so we know when the right time to come for drinks,she made them perfect,she let us know,she's not usually there that early,so we lucked out...happy about that,the place is nice and clean and beautiful decor,I would definitely go back,the waitress was alright"
"82|2|DO NOT go to this cheesecake factory. This is the WORST one I've ever been to. Just my luck and what I get for being lazy & settling for the closest place to eat.  But since I've been to several Cheesecake factories, I didn't think it would be bad. Where do I start??We ordered Hibachi hangar steak with onions & shiitake mushrooms,  with wasabi mashed potatoes, & tempura asparagus, and Carbonara pasta. I'm so glad we passed on apps and just stuck with the bread.  The only positive was the fact that they did give two mini loaves of the brown bread that I do like. First of all we asked for water she brought the water out and didn't even provide straws. I looked over at other tables and noticed they didn't have any straws either. So we didn't bother asking for any.  But I'm a little OCD and I don't usually like putting my mouth on the glasses. Ok fine I dealt with it.  But we drank our water, and after she took our order we weren't able to flag her down for more water.  It wasn't crowded in there, waitresses need to be a little more attentive- like look over and see if the glasses need refilling.Moving on from the water situation- our food took forever to come out & I get the fact that it's steak and needs to cook to order, however, if that's the case then when it comes out it should be piping hot,  no? OH my freaking goodness! It was cold and my steak was purple!!! I asked for it medium. I specifically told her I want it pink inside. The mushrooms and onions were a joke.  I had a huge piece of onion skin in my dish. The mashed potatoes were cold, with huge chunks of grey potatoes, so cold that the butter they put on top would barely melt & wasabi??? What wasabi?? There wasn't even a hint.  My asparagus was cut into little pieces.  On to the carbonara, it was super watery.. & I know that when you make pasta you usually have to put it into a sautee pan with some pasta water and sauce to coat the pasta well.  Obviously they added too much pasta water in the process.Now on to the service. The black girl with the platinum blonde shoulder length curly hair was the waitress who started us out (sorry not to offend anyone, I just forgot her name and if someone from the restaurant reads this I want them to know who she is) she practically dropped the plates of food down onto the table, she never checked on us except right when she walked away after ""dropping"" our plates off literally 3 seconds later.  She didn't refill water, nothing!!  We then were told by another girl while talking over her back that she was going to be taking over. We never saw her again. Again, it wasn't that crowded. We had to flag down blonde girl to ask for water and then after another long while flag her down again to ask for the check because the other girl who was supposedly taking over never came to us. Finally blonde girl brings the bag and container and practically dropped it into the carbonara. We then flagged down second girl to take the credit card. I was so disgusted. I'll never step foot in that place again. I always get cheesecake to take home. I didn't even do that.  But then again none of the waitresses even asked if we wanted to order desserts."
"83|1|Great time! The servers are usually nice, the food is made well and comes out pretty fast. It's super loud all of the time though. Sometimes the amount of screaming kids gets annoying though."
"84|3|I live in the area, & was very excited to have TCF open their 1st Queens restaurant close by. I've been a couple of times, but the experience was not the same as when i first went to TCF. I remember huge portions, & ordering cheesecake, b/c, well, you were @ TCF. Now, i notice that it's the plate that is huge, & not so much the portions; &, the cheesecake, both times was very small. I had seen another customer w/ a bigger slice, & wondered. I'm still glad it's in the area, but haven't made another trip back."
"85|2|I'll start by saying the staff was fine. The woman at the desk who took our name and gave us our vibrator thingy was efficient and cordial. But the system for seating people is cluttered and inefficient. She took our pager and told us to wait around the other side of the huge column, which is a convergence of people coming to the door to leave and had us feeling like we were in the way.It's far too loud. My husband and I could not talk without shouting. We're getting old. We don't like to shout at one another to have a simple conversation. It's also way too dim. I almost couldn't read the menu, which seriously needs to be edited. Cut out 150 items and do the other 100 well.Our waiter, while service was slow, was polite and answered my questions about the Blood Orange Martini. The drink was between $12 and $14...but you only got the drink in the glass. You are not served the shaker with another drink and a half, like you get at Applebee's for about the same price. So I laughed and did not get anything more than a soda. But we never got water. Do they not bring it automatically? Were we supposed to ask for it?We decided to try the truffle bacon cheese sticks. Basically, it's a grilled cheese with bacon that is cut into four strips. I couldn't tell you what the cheese was because it had no flavor. The bacon was the only part of it that did have flavor, though it was toasted nicely. The tomato dipping sauce tasted like straight tomato paste. Not even cooked tomato paste. And it was unseasoned. Tasted like it came directly out of the can with nothing done to it. Some restaurants don't understand that tomato paste needs to be cooked to get rid of that canned paste flavor. I had one stick out of four and a small taste of the tomato paste.I ordered the Carne Asada Steak Medallions, ""Covered with Sauteed Peppers, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Creamy Ranchero Sauce, Fresh Corn and White Rice"" the menu says. Well, the peppers and onions need to go another four or five minutes to begin to be called sauteed. They were warmed but largely still crisp and uncooked. I also found a mushroom slice. So it's a good thing my mother wasn't with us and didn't get that plate, because she's allergic to them. That's careless prep. My rice was dry as a bone and CRUSTY. The corn was there. It had these salty bits of what I imagine is a queso. The steak itself is underseasoned but the sauce with it had this mysterious heat to it. No real flavor to speak of. Just heat. It went away quickly with a bite of the bread that had been brought at the beginning of the meal.There's always this quandry when you order steak at a place you've never been before. Do I order it medium and hope they go under and I get it rare? Or will they overcook and it comes to me well and I have to send it back? Do I order it rare and maybe they go over to a medium, which I can usually deal with, or will they under and I get it blue? Well, I took the risk. I ordered rare. I got blue.I actually had to get out my phone's flashlight to see just how blue it was. I should have sent it back, but I do enjoy a well-prepared rare/very rare steak sometimes. I'm now regretting NOT sending it back, as supper has not been sitting well ever since (for either of us). From my entire entree plate, I ate the meat, a couple bites of corn, and one single bite of rice. I almost stopped at Burger King on my way home, but my stomach has been so upset I just came home and popped an antacid. I did tell the waiter about the rice when he picked up my plate. He took $4 off the entree, which I do appreciate.My husband ordered the orange chicken. His rice was also bone dry. The vegetables on his plate were barely past warmed, not much cooked. The chicken itself was not a crisp deep fry. The sauce was not spicy, as the menu describes, and there was this odd flavor on the back end of a bite. Like grated, burnt orange peel. It wasn't very pleasant. Panda Express in the food court does a MUCH better and FAR MORE REASONABLY PRICED orange chicken. They also have much better rice.The table next to us, who had been seated, with alcoholic beverages AND water before us, were brought their entrees after ours, btw, so I hope they weren't upset about that.A very serious suggestion for the restaurant: Make miniature versions of your desserts and offer a ""Flight"" of 3 or 5 flavors, so that customers can have a taste of several desserts. I seriously counted 17 different desserts I wanted to try. If I could get a flight of five and my husband could get a flight of five, that's ten desserts we both could share and try.We settled on the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake. That was seriously the best part of the meal other than the bread at the beginning. The toasted meringue on top was quite tasty. It's not a sickly sweet lemon, but a nice, tart lemon. It was terrific, and the reason our trip gets one star and not a ""wish I could give half a star"" notation."
86|2|The company is good but the food was salty and just warm. Disappointed. The cheesecake was ok but took too long.
87|3|I have to say that food was ok. Exactly what you can expect from them. The service though was slow like everyone else mentioned here. And for some reason my waiter always talked to us over the top of the wall of the booth.
88|3|Food was very good! The problem is the service. They kept messing up our orders and they kept bringing out food that we already said we didn't want. Service can be improved on a lot!
89|2|Birthday celebration dinner for someone special at the Cheesecake Factory in Elmhurst. Our first time trying the restaurant.Be warn they don't take reservations so if you have a large party over 6 ppl prepare to wait Got there and put my name down and was told it's an 2 hour wait.  I was like did I hear wrong did you just say 2 hrs. Yep someone ahead of me also big a party. So I am like just great I got kids who are starving. Waited for a bit an hour had passed. The kids were starting to get restless and my Brother ask if they can put us in 2 separate table instead at this point in desperation. So they had booth that can fit 6 ppl each but unfortunately it wasn't back to back. Another party was in between us. Oh well we took it otherwise it will be another hour wait. We had to get up back and forth during the night just to talk. Could have gone to Longhorn or Olive Garden which was only a 30-40 mins wait. But the special person really wanted to try this restaurant out. The food overall was pretty good. I didn't like how the cocktail menu had no price listed. The hostess could be more bit accommodating and suggest to us if we prefer to wait or can try to seat us separately. Instead we as patrons had to ask due to the long long wait time.
"90|1|It is always the best food made by Cheesecake Factory , and today I discover another delicious dish "" Tuscan Chicken"" , and thanks to the very nice waiter girl Jocelynn P. for her recommendation!"
"91|3|We came here for my daughters graduation/birthday dinner!! Im hoping all goes well, as i continue.First off, the place looks very nice inside and out. We walked in and said table for 3, she asked my name and when I asked how long is the wait she replied no wait. To me no wait means someone is waiting to seat me, now I know why she asked for my name and oh by the way there was a short wait.The waitress came after about 5 minutes to get our drinks and appetizer order. She seemed very nice and accommodating. Her happiness somewhat makes up for my wait/no wait when we first came in.Drinks and appetizers came. My virgin pina colada could have been better, but it was just ok. My daughter liked her raspberry lemonade and her father just had water, which is hard to mess up. Appetizers, fried calamari and crab puffs, again ok, but tasty.Now to main course, which was the stars of the show, pics below. Everything hot and delicious, thank GOD! I have no complaints on my salmon, and everyone was happy with there food!Lastly, the reason people come.....the cheesecake!!! We had different cheesecakes, different flavors, all what we expected! No pics because we dug in and forgot, lol! It was good though.Overall, pretty decent experience. Unfortunately I have to take a star off for my no wait/wait when we entered and the slightly rude sarcastic waiter that tried to apologize and another star for the waitress Pricilla. She took the orders fine, but didn't really check on us and how the food was. I would give 3 1/2 stars if i could, but Yelp doesn't work that way!"
"92|2|My family and I came here on Sunday to celebrate my cousin's 20th birthday. We ordered brunch and waited over an hour for our food! We ordered French toast and waffles, all which were delivered with no butter or maple syrup. Instead, we were given Smucker's sugar free syrup in a take-out container which was cold (picture included). My cousin, who ordered chicken and waffles, was only given HALF a waffle. To thwart this discovery, they placed some over fried potatoes in the space from the partial waffle. We requested a manager and Eric came over to the table. He heard us but did not listen. He promised maple syrups but thirty minutes and a withered waffle later we were informed that there was no maple syrup. My cousin also never received a complete waffle. My aunt and cousins did enjoy the cucumber lemonade. Pedro was also a very pleasant waiter who made up for the lackluster management. It's also worth mentioning that after waiting thirty/forty minutes for syrup and being told they did not have any, we saw a waiter walk past with a searing cup of syrup. Nevertheless, we won't be celebrating another birthday here and unless you are on the mood for drama that makes you leave hungry, I suggest you also avoid dining here at all costs!"
"93|2|I have been eating the Miso salmon from the Cheesecake Factory for over 20 years. It is my go-to meal when I need something quick and don't want to cook at home. I'm not sure what this is that they gave me but the salmon was burnt, and the brown sauce which is normally a dark sauce with a glaze texture was watery and the color of gravy. I can't describe how awful the taste was, the only thing I can say is it tasted like it had been fermenting for weeks. I was going to leave a negative review the last time I came here, but decided to let it slide. I ordered extra sauce and they gave me less than half an ounce of sauce. The sauce was on the side and the food was completely dry! The amount of sauce they gave me was barely enough to drizzle on my salmon.... rice was dry. Unreal that you guys charge these prices and have such awful service!"
"94|1|The wait time was approx 45 min and still I had a very pleasant experience. My waitress was very attentive and kind. The food was good. It's a franchised restaurant, nothing spectacular and unique about it. I wouldn't do this spot for a first date. Its more like ""we been together for a while and I want to go out and eat"" spot. It is great for a teenage date or dinner with your friends. I had a great time . Parking is available for a small price. Browse the mall while you wait."
"95|1|Came here for lunch on a Wednesday, no wait needed. Our waitress was so nice and patient. And food was as expected. I always order the seared tuna salad and of course it was delicious. Had the mushroom cream soup and it was pretty good( first time trying it) atmosphere was casual and very airy (on the count of it being at the mall it felt very spacious)"
96|1|Went to buy 4 cheesecakes to go. The service is nice the cheesecakes are great  no complains at all the staffs are great. The only thing that I didn't like was the way the cheesecakes was pack one of my order got the the icing all over. But still I'm giving this place  a five star. That's the only thing tho just be careful of the way you pack it. Over all still the best place for cheesecakes.
"97|2|Conveniently located in the Queens Center mall with plenty of free parking around when you're lucky, The Cheesecake Factory has a very friendly staff. The wait time is long but you have the luxury of shopping around while you wait. They call you when your table is ready which is really nice.The food is low in average because it lacks flavor. I ordered the lemon garlic shrimp which came out very garlicky and buttery. Maybe the lack of flavor is because It came off the skinny menu.  The shrimp was rubbery. My friend's got the California salads but the tastiest was the Detox salad. The appetizer we ordered were the mixed egg rolls which were  delicious especially with the sauces. This place is fun for the experience and the atmosphere. Food is not satisfying. I didn't try the cheesecake but many of the tables around me had it coming to the tables non-stop so I'm sure it is delicious."
"98|2|I came here for my birthday and was super disappointed. Normally I come for lunch special or weekend brunch and the service is ok. But this time my waiter disappeared for very long intervals, then switched with another guy, the whole process took over 2 hours. Not all of the entrees came out at once and they forgot my sisters food, when she finally got it her food was cold!! They also brought my fiance the wrong drink and charged me for a birthday cake I did not want but the waiter pushed onto us making it out like it was free. Worst experience ever. Took forever to just get the check. Spent so much money and the food was cold and nothing special. Never coming here again for a special occasion!"
99|1|Always clean and food tastes good. Long waits during dinner especially towards the weekends. Expect to wait. Service always courteous and professional. Keith is a waiter that really stands out for me. The level of his service and manner would make you think you were at a high end dining establishment. As it should be.
"100|1|My friend took me out to eat here for my 23rd birthday, and it was amazing! The food is great and comes in large portions and it is all decently priced! You have so many options to choose from, all which vary greatly from one another. Definitely recommend you get the fried mac and cheese balls! I'm dying to go back just to get my hands on some more!! The servers are amazing and the service is on point. We got our appetizers and drinks 15 minutes after ordering them and our entrees 20 minutes after ordering, which is great considering the place was overly packed due to the holidays. I understand the wait to actually get seated is horrible, but its easy to kill time since this location is in a mall.Definitely recommend everyone to come here!"
"101|1|Very impressed with the service here. Came here on their grand opening day and there were A LOTTTT of people. We came during off peak hours and still waited around 20min Me and my friend really looked forward to this and it certainly didn't disappoint. We came with the mind to order the pasta and cheesecake, however the pasta was way DAMN filling(but delish) and we couldn't fit the cheesecake. (Thanks for that, CHEESECAKE factory) I ordered the four cheese pasta, it was unexpectedly good because hearing 4 cheese it might be too cheesy, but it's actually not. It's blended with marinara sauce and isn't too salty. My fiend ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta and it was actually really good, a bit spicy( for her, for me it tasted so weak spicy haha) but I personally thought it was a bit salty. Service is definitely 5 stars. VERYYYYY good customer service. I hope they keep it up and that it wasn't just a first day attitude kind of thing. Will be backkkk (for the cheesecake now actually)"
"102|1|Yum Yum Yum!Even if you are from Mars and dont like cheesecake, You need to come here! Ambiance: Gorgeous. As we were lead to our seats I noticed the Bars had about Two T.V.s and about 8ish Seats. I did not try any alcohol but I noted that there was a large selection available. The seating can be great if you sit way in the back where it is intimate and private Or it can be kinda close to other parties in the middle where it is a bit louder. Food: So finally after being seated we received the thickest menu I ever saw. It took me a while to decide between many great options. When the food came it was Oh So Tasty! My Diane Steak/Shrimp Campi Combo was well done and still juicy with some tenderness. My Date had the hibachi steak which was not as tender but just as tasty and delicious. You could taste the wine in the steak. The machpotaotes taste as good as they look in the pictures. The appetizers came out WARM! Loved that. Avocado Rolls and Toast Avocado. Quality Food! Juniors Vs. The Cheesecake Factory (CHEESECAKE REVIEW): Get the Chocolate Hazel! You won't regret it & I think a portion goes to feeding the needy. I haven't had Juniors in a while so take this with a grain of salt (No Pun intended) but The cheesecakes here I found to be fresher and more tasty. I had the Fresh Strawberry & Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch & Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake  And they all were very smooth in taste and the perfect softness to the crust. I'm not a big cheesecake fan, I prefer ice cream cake but these cheesecakes were really good and not over the top. TRY IT!Customer Service: By far Daphnie and the others who also came to our table gave great customer service skills! She was very clear and thorough. We came on a Thursday night around busy after work hours 7 pm and waited 1 hour and 12 mins but I expected the long wait given they just opened this week. Its better to come here for brunch or lunch if you cant wait. Also I was told that they do not take RSVP yet. The staff here works as a team (Which I loved) So many people will check up on you. It was attentive without being too attentive or disturbing. My utmost compliments to Daphnie and The Manger (a chubby bald guy in a blue shirt). This team screams great communication skills. My water was always filled, & the appetizers came out at a decent time, followed by the food. The soft drinks did take a lil long.Cleanliness: Please note They did not have their letter grade up, which is important to me but the place was pretty much clean. My utensils were spotless (Not even the ugly water stain), My waiter put my knife ""sitting"" on the table (I loved that). My glass seemed clean and none of the waiters or waitresses or busboys walked around with dirty towels or stained shirts. Everything was neat and clean. BUT I WANT MY LETTER GRADE POSTED b/c It would help to know that the kitchen is clean.PS! They are one of those very few restaurants who still pack the food for you when it's time to go! I must have shed a tear or two for this when I realized I didnt have to do it myself. #FirstWorldProblemsT.I.Ps:(1) There is NO COAT CHECK(2) At this time, You can not RSVP. First come first serve. Dont take the the little Buzzer past JCPenny(3) There is NO Separate PARKING. (Park in the Mall Parking Lot as this factory is part of the mall)(4) Dress Code: I saw a lot of couples the wait for two is crazy and they dress up/ very few families, and lots of groups of friends who dressed casually. Skinny leg jeans and cute shoes and cute sweater will do. Cute Chic/Not too dressy(5) Most Entrees are between 15$ and 22$. Some Small slice Cakes were 6-8$ Enjoy!"
"103|2|Lordy!!! I made the mistake of thinking that coming here on a Saturday night was a good idea. It was ridiculously crowded, so many people everywhere, blocking doors, angry, so much disorganization, just complete chaos.I didn't bother staying for dinner, the wait was about 2hrs or more. I decided to just get cheesecake and go, well even that took 11mins. There a guy who had placed a to-go order and had been waiting an 1 1/2. lol they need to get it together."
104|2|Really not impressed with the service. We were at the bar and our food came not to our liking at all. I ordered medium well and got a very well done filet mignon. Such a waste of a good cut of meat. I'm starving so I had to eat it even though.
"105|2|The most enjoyable thing about my experience was my waitress. She was so attentive and sweet! Other than that everything else was subpar. I ordered Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, not spicy at all as I thought it would be, but it was really salty I mixed everything together and still was unable to finish it. We ordered the fried Mac and cheese balls which was good, but also salty and the factory nachos which were not as good this time as the last time I got them. Don't think I will be back here since, I never get cheesecake the calories are insane!"
"106|3|I have always been a big fan of The cheese cake factory and was excited to see one in Queens!This location has a very nice atmosphere, the food was good and the prices are reasonable (for the food). They have a healthy food option menu! which i loved! They list the calories, very helpful! The staff very friendly and sweet, BUT the service was a bit slow, (got a soup and had to wait for the spoon) My biggest complaint here is the price of the cocktails, got 2 Mojitos for $12.50 EACH! I say, very overpriced, and i don't know if the price is listed on the menu, i did not see it, and if it was, it was not very visible...other than that, it was a good experience overall."
"107|3|Came here with a few of my co-workers and we had a blast! It was the opening week and it was hell trying to get a table. The waits were ridiculously long, but we did end up finding seats at the bar after half an hour of stalking the high tops. The service was pretty quick given the amount of people there for opening week. Our bartender always made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that the food and cheesecake took FOREVER to come out. I'm sure they were overwhelmed with orders, so I understand, it was just tough because we were all so hungry.If you're looking to get a drink here, get the pineapple moscow mule. It is delicious and has a gigantic slice of fresh pineapple in your drink. For dinner, I had the chicken bellagio (which is my go to dish here) and the tiramisu cheesecake. The chicken bellagio was smaller in portion size than at some of the other Cheesecakes I've been to, but the quality is better. It was also decorated very nicely. I really enjoyed the tiramisu cheesecake. It was light an fluffy, but it made me so thirsty afterwards. I had to chug three glasses of water just to feel slightly hydrated.Overall, had a good experience here. Good company, good food and good drinks! Just wish the ticket time was a bit shorter."
"108|1|I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory but heard so many good things about them , I got very excited to see one opening in Queens.Be ready to wait in line for a while. The food itself was decent and the cheesecake, delicious. I would definitely go back , most likely at a quiet time !"
109|2|Great service. Food portions is less than other Cheesecake Factories but same price. Food quality was also pretty bad. Ordered Spicy cashew chicken and it was way too sweet almost inedible. My friend order of Shrimp w/ angel hair pasta. Order was missed but manager handled it very well and paid for his dish. But it came out overdone and soggy...If the service wasn't good this would be a one star review. Probably would not come back. Wait was almost 3 hours but that would hopefully change after the hype dies down.
"110|1|In a word, tremendous. I was blown away at how awesome everything was. We went to eat there at around 1pm on a Friday and the place was packed to the gills. Make sure you call ahead with reservations because we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for a table. Everyone was super nice and efficient. As busy as the place was, no one was overwhelmed. So 5 stars for the managers, waitstaff and chefs as well.As for the food? Hot damn. I don't know what else to tell you other than it was out of this fucking world. For 4 people, we ended up getting the guacamole egg roll and fried mac and cheese ball appetizers.For entrees:--I got the Steak Diane (delicious sauce and perfectly cooked steak)--Country chicken and biscuits (my girl went nuts over this and she's still talking about it).--fish tacos for my friend (they were delicious and not fishy at all)--and a bowl of mac and cheese for our friend's 2 year old son.For desert: The crunchy Nutella cheesecake that we all split (and couldn't even finish).PROS:-great food. Even though it's a big menu, every item on the menu seems fantastic.-great service -they have health optionsCONS:- because of how busy it is, that plus the music they were playing through the speaker system, it can be a little loud...and if you have a kid, make sure you break ear phones because the 2 year old at the table kept saying how loud the place was. So just a FYI.- because the place is so new they really want to make a good impression. The problem with this was, we had about (not kidding) 3 people constantly checking in on us. So every few minutes someone else would come up to the table and say ""is everything alright?"" Then 60 seconds later someone else would say ""just checking to make sure everything is alright."" Then a few minutes later someone else would come up to our table and say ""just wanna make sure everything is okay."" Every time we told them we were fine. It was a little annoying so I'm not gonna take away any stars.All in all, it was tremendous. Can't wait to go back."
111|3|This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory. Overall the experience was good. The serve was great from start to finish. Because it was my first time I went to my go to dish chicken Alfredo. The issue is that my chicken was can chicken. As a cook you know the difference between can food and real food. If my chicken was real they would've gotten 5 stars.
112|1|Haven't dined in but always done take out. Staff is nice and friendly. Only downfall is the wait time.I always get the avocado rolls and buffalo blasts and whatever cheesecake I'm craving that day. That is all!
"113|3|The thing with the Cheesecake Factory is that they know no matter what, people will still come here, likely myself included although in recent years the crazy wait times has made me steer very clear of coming here.  This location opened last year when I was still living nearby and back then, it wasn't unusual to have 2+ hour wait times for a table for two. These days, things have slowed down a bit but the wait times are often still bizarre. So why despite everyone's love for chain restaurants, do I want to write a review? It actually came down to one instance. While I feel I've always had a 3/5 star experience (not just this Cheesecake Factory, but every Cheesecake Factory location), given the long wait time, servers in the past forgetting to bring silverware, coming back to tell me multiple times what I ordered is unavailable, etc, I came here recently ahead of my larger party to put my name down for a table and was told 20 minutes despite the restaurant being pretty empty. My party came in soon after through a different door and didn't see me already waiting and asked for a table as well and they were seated immediately. (WHAT?!) I don't understand why I was told to wait by one hostess when another hostess sat the same party immediately.This makes me think that the wait times are often disproportionately exaggerated and you want us to wait just for the sake of waiting. The food is good and the cheesecake is obviously what we all come for, but I'm going to be skeptical of these alleged wait times now for sure."
"114|2|Went here on a Thursday night. Waited 15-20 minutes for a table which isn't bad for this location. Waited another 15 minutes to have a waitress come over to give us a menu. Another 15 minutes after that for her to come back and order drinks. Drinks took forever to come, and same with the food. Place wasn't that crowded. Waitress could have been better with her service. Barely came by, and gives my table bread half way through the meal. Drinks are expensive here. $13.00 for a margarita. Food was not worth the wait at all. Wouldn't come back."
115|1|This was the best choice I've made all week. After a great workout me and my cousin decided to stop in here for a quick bite. We were greeted by the awesome hostess Michelle by the bar. She suggested I get the chicken Madeira and my cousin Get the soup and salad. My meal was absolutely succulent and hearty. They even gave me a sample of the soup of the day which was pretty cool. This will be my new place to dine frequent.
"116|2|It is the first time I come to this place that I have a very bad experience with the service, the food is very tasty and the drinks are also the problem, the waitress that took us about half an hour to take the order and when she brought the food  that we didn't have  I had to ask another waiter for water because the waitress who was serving us did not pay attention to us as if he did not bring money to pay and the difference was seen when he attended the two winged tables"
"117|1|When we got there in the evening, there was about a 15 minute wait. There's a display of all the different cheesecakes up front  I had the tiramisu cheesecake which was amazing!!"
118|2|EDIT: You can see CCF reaches out below to make it seem as if they care to follow up about your experience but I have yet to hear back after contacting them.
119|1|This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to. Very welcoming staff and quick food preparation after you order. The bartenders are super chatty and friendly and the overall restaurant is well taken care of and has a pleasant atmosphere. Highly recommend after a day of shopping in the mall it is attached to.
"120|1|Because the restaurant is new I decided to go early to avoid the madness. Thankfully I did. We decided to sit at the bar area. Drew and Lindsey were awesome. Very attentive to our needs. They made the experience pleasant. I got the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and they were amazing. Great portions for the price. No more driving to Long Island, Upstate or NJ to go to Cheesecake Factory. Although, it being walking distance now may be dangerous to my waist line."
121|1|Going to this specific location is usually a hit or miss with the wait time due to it being connected to queens center mall. Other than the wait being a problem this restaurant is amazing! The staff are super friendly and the food tastes really good..
"122|2|Started off fine. Friendly waitress, yummy bread. Delicious drinks. Then the maincourse took forever and the food came barely warm. Fries were not crispy nor hot! Asked for steak knives, never got them. Then the waitress went on break, person who cover never came to our table. Finally asked for a cheque after 30 minutes wait. Took another 20 min for someone to pick up the payment. We wasted almost an hour at the end NOT able to get dessert because no one bother to come to take the order! All the table around us got their service and already left way before us. It is frustrating."
"123|1|I had the farfalle pasta, it was very good. The problem is that I have made changes to the dish that the Kitchen agreed to, but when the dish arrived, it was missing some key ingredients. It was still very good, could have been better. The staff was welcoming and nice. Our server was missing at times and the other servers took our requests. Very professional on their behalf. Another nice moment was when we first set down,  we were 4 adults and my baby boy.  We asked for a high chair and it was ready by our table and the hostess was so nice, she brought me some warm bread and a sliced banana for my baby without even asking... Will definitely come back again."
"124|2|It was disgusting. Waited 1 hour to be seated. And one hour to get food. Asked for steak and shrimp combo with pasta instead of mash potatoes. Bill was $150 for everything my family and I had ordered and they brought it out cold. And they had the nerve to leave the middle of my plate empty where the pasta WAS supposed to be and say ""pasta is coming out soon."" Sent all the food back to get reheated to the point where I burned my hand from touching the plate. Pasta was hard and not boiled. Food terrible. I would have been more satisfied eating at Burger King."
125|1|The Dulce Leche cheesecake is out if this world!  I love this place!I love their menu items too!  The portions are large and the plates are tasty.  Sometimes on the weekends you'll have to wait for a seat.  I suggest to make reservations or get there early to put your name down for seating.
"126|3|I would start by saying that I'm addicted to their avocado egg roll , bread and banana cheese cake butttt and there's a big but , this place is crowdy , noisy , the dishes are not that clean at all , but I understand why so many people love coming here , the prices are honest , the portions are huge but it really bothers me that you can barley hear yourself ."
"127|2|Food was mediocre and customer service wasn't good at all. The waiter that handled us was very unprofessional named Henry. They'll argue with you because they believe you're wrong. Henry didn't even have the courtesy to apologize to us for starting an argument. We tried being civil and explaining the situation and Henry didn't respect that, he raised his voice and started raising his voice. If I had the opportunity to give zero stars I would. Wait was also about an hour. Our bread came out rock hard. Overall, a nightmare of a dinner experience"
"128|1|Im not usually a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I'm a sucker for this place. Lots of choices in terms of appetizers, mains, drinks, and desserts, pretty good food, and yummy cheesecake! The wait can be obscene during peak times (think weekends, holidays), and their waiting system leaves something to be desired compared to other Cheesecake Factory locations, but the bartenders and waitstaff are actually super attentive, friendly, and professional, which is awesome. This is a much-needed addition to the Queens Center Mall!"
"129|2|I am a fan of the cheesecake factory, but not this one. Not only did they refuse to seat us because our party wasn't all there when the table was available they made us wait another 90 minutes! They have no clue how to seat medium sized  groups, and we were only 6!!  2 which were young children!  You don't know how to move two adjacent tables together!? Seriously wtf!?  If you are a party of two you have quicker seating. By the time we sat down we already knew what we wanted cause we studied the damn menu for 90 minutes!  You think cause the server knew we waited so long she'd  expedite our order cause the children were starving. Nope. Another 45 minutes. Well how about some of that free bread to hold us over? One basket! For 6 mouths. Our basket was empty in 60 seconds. No refill.Let's talk about portion size. I ordered the chicken maderia and steak Diane special. It was 3 pieces of steak and 1 palm size chicken breast. You bet I'm upset! I was already Hangry!  From that long wait and half piece of bread! Did I mention we arrived well past lunch. It was 2pm. We weren't eating until close to 4!  I would never ever dine at this location again. I'll take my cheesecake to go!"
"130|1|I havent been to the cheesecake factory in a long time, and was pleased when I visited this location with my friend and her two kids. First thing first the waiter was so sweet and engaging and also he was very patient with the kids. He suggested the quesadilla and chips and guacamole and we quickly agreed. The food was delicious quesadilla were huge and full of flavor. We both ended up getting the bacon cheeseburger. DELICIOUS!! Juicy burger, crispy bacon it was really good.. I couldnt finish it lol but it was delicious. Of course we ended the lunch by purchasing cheesecake. I got the reese's peanut butter cheesecake and my friend got the strawberry cheesecake.. both were delicious. Thank you to our waiter Gerard wonderful young man, I hope to see him again when we visit soon."
"131|2|Terrible service, 45 minutes for burned steakCareless manager and service, waste of time. The worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to."
"132|1|Came to eat dinner before Thanksgiving with my fam. It was around 5pm and luckily we got seated after waiting for 20min., which isn't bad. The food we ordered...1. Pineapple Moscow Mule- really good! Can barely taste the vodka. It was like pineapple juice.2. Fried Mac and Cheese- loved it! Crunchy on the outside and cheesy inside.3. Steak Diane (medium rare)- it was a bit overcooked at some part but it was still pretty good. Mashed Potatoes was pretty good as well.4. Chicken Marsala and Mushroom w. Bowtie Pasta (forgot the name)- more to the sweeter side but still good. 5. Southern Fried Catfish- The catfish was really soft, which is great! Mashed potatoes ofc was good. The only thing that I didn't really like was how slow the service is. It takes a while for them to serve all the food out, so expect that to happen. Either the chefs gotta learn how to cook faster or they gotta hire more chefs. Overall, the food was pretty good so I didn't mind about the long wait. We were too full so we didn't get the chance to try some cheesecake but next time. The total was about $88 including tax, not bad. Had to bring some leftovers home since we couldn't finish it."
133|2|Save your money and go somewhere else where your money and appetite is worth. This  used to be my favorite place but it totally fell off. Maybe it's because of  new management or lack of. They don't give you bread unless you have a party of 3 or more. The female servers are very rude and nasty. I had several occasions where the female servers banged my glass beverage at my table and the beverage splashed all over me and she didn't even say sorry. The other female server shoves a hot plate at my sisters face and has the nerve to tell her place it on the table herself. The other female server had the worst attitude and got annoyed because I as a customer asked her for extra plates and forks. What a way to get tips right?
134|1|Best Cheesecake Ever!!!! Their pastas are terrific as well but I mainly went to try the Chocolate Tuxedo Cake for my birthday and it was like a dream! Highly recommend!
"135|2|What a disappointment...have never been here, so today I decided to give a try, place is beautiful I give them that, but service on the other hand (never had any after 20 minutes of waiting in the booth).  We a party of 4 picked what we wanted to eat....we waited...waited no one ever came to us.  We did get our plates and silverware when seated only interaction.  Looked across the street OLIVE GARDEN here we come"
"136|1|On July 7 we went to eat there with Daniela and Freddie from colombia, the dinner and the service was spectacular, my plate was chicken Parmesan pizza , my wife had the quesadilla with chicken much better then we have had in other Restaurants, Freddie had a special burger which he raved about it . The reason we went was to have their famous cheese cake we where so full we did not order dessert. But after all we do want to say this place is worth going to will refer to all my friends and family."
"137|1|The food wasn't great but we had a great server. We were there about a month ago with a huge party and many people. Our waitress Charisse was very patient, polite and helpful."
138|1|The food and drinks here are amazing. Love getting the Chipotle chicken pasta and their margaritas and mojitos. The downside is that their wait time is always 40-50 mins.
"139|2|Filet mignon... even if I asked for it well done, (which I didn't) it still shouldn't come out like this. Waste of time coming here. 1  1/2 hour wait to get a burnt steak."
140|1|My best friend brought me here for my birthday and we had a wonderful time.  We arrived on a Tuesday as soon as the restaurant opened. Our waiter was fantastic and very attentive. The food was really delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my Mac and Cheesw burger- it was cooked to perfection and the portion lent itself to sharing. This was my first time at this particular location and I will be returning on May 19th to celebrate my daughters 12th birthday. I look forward to having another fantastic experience!
"141|2|Yesterday, I called to make a reservation for get together for my friends and family. The lady that answered the call was very condescending, and she was mocking my accent constantly; I can hear her smirky sound. I felt disrespected and that behavior was not necessary. The lady said her name is Marissa; the call was made around 10:20pm on March 26, 2019. I feel she could be an liability to the well reputed Cheesecake Factory, not an asset. I would definitely not recommend anyone this restaurant. I can only imagine the ambiance the employee like these can create in the restaurant."
"142|1|My mom turned 94 this week, so I planned a birthday party at her favorite restaurant!!!!!Mom eats there with friends all the time.The party was yesterday....Lot's of mom's friends and lot's of the friends I grew up with came and everyone was soooo glad the party was at Cheesecake. We were allll so well taken care of. And everyone loved everything from the appetizers through the main dish's and the cakes for desert.We all had a really good time together....especially my mom!I'm gonna take mom back sometime in the coming week."
"143|1|This is a great place to go on a date on a budget. When I went with my boyfriend they sat us right always, so there was no wait at all. We ordered and in less than 30 minutes everything we ordered was served. All the food was nice and fresh. They give a good amount of food too we even ended up taking leftovers home."
"144|1|I'm really shocked at the negative reviews. I went here with friends and family a few days ago on a Sunday 1/20, and everything was absolutely amazing. The manager was so caring of everyone dining and his manners and attention to how things were going really shocked us all. It was pleasant. The food was delicious and greattt portions. We had about 5 different cheesecakes and they were all amazing as well. I can't speak for other customers experiences, but my crew and I were so satisfied with the food and service. The manager is really going above and beyond (really sorry that I forgot his name), but thank you!"
"145|3|Tonight's service was very bad, I don't know what but the bartenders missed their mark. The guys in the picture completely ignored us, he literally attended everyone but us at the table! I have been here when it's busy and I get it, but the bar isn't full. Very hit or miss with these bartenders."
"146|2|I have been going to Cheesecake for over 17 years but times have not changed for the better. When I first stared to go to cheesecake factory it was great, the food portions where hugh and I never left hungry. I would always order the SAME entree and take some food home because I was not able to finish it.Now this place is designed to rip YOU off.  The serve huge plates with very small food portions. The size of their entree plates are three times the size of the food they serve you. All designed to rip YOU off. I had a entree that I paid $24 and I ate it in less than 3 minutes, that's how small the food portion is. Really. I am not a big person weighing only 150 pounds. if you are over 200 pounds I would recommend ordering two full orders for yourself. If you don't mind being ripped off then you will enjoy this place."
147|2|Horrible wait timeThe food arrived coldAnd no flavor .Only the cheesecake is fresh . Go somewhere else for lunch or dinner.
148|2|I'm only giving 2 stars for the delicious red velvet cheese cake.. I came for my friends birthday he had never had food from the cheesecake factory I had and thought it was great that a location was close to Brooklyn.  Boy was I wrong   ..I ordered the spicy jambalaya with pasta. When I stuck my fork in it literally picked up a lump if pasta and right away it just didn't seem right I assumed maybe I just needed to taste it.  It tasted bland and the shrimp tasted like mush rubber from the shrimp being over cooked and the chicken tasted like it needed to be sauteed a little more.  I had to get a whole other order.  I chose to get the herb crusted a salmon which was 100% better but by the time I got it I full off gas and had to take it home.  The birthday was also very un happy with his meal he had shrimp and steak Diane which was really 3 shrimp with a lot of mash potatoes and 3 small pieces of steak more like cubes.  I asked for medium well and received well done he requested it to be done over with no sauce and they got it right the second time around.  Another person from our party ordered the Jamaican shrimp with black beans and that was horrible also.  The black beans looked dry and stale the plantains were fried so black we thought it was meat and the shrimp was also over cooked.  The manager trued to rectify the situation as best as he could.  For this to be a brand new location on a non busy day the best thing was the cheesecakes!!
149|2|Ordered delivery through an app. Got the meatloaf... and explain to me why the inside was red? A meatloaf is cooked for hours...didn't understand why it was also a bit frozen in the middle as well. It was disgusting. Never again will I order or eat from this location.
"150|1|My wife took me to celebrate my birthday with a late lunch/ early dinner here. Ordered a Manhattan to get started, good but there was an exception. The server; Brian, very pleasent sent over the manager in order to address my concern, resulting in an outstanding cocktail. The dinner was delicious and enjoyed by all. The Carmel Macadamia cheesecake was the desert of choice. Comfortable establishment and attentive staff. Looking forward to returning in near future. Thanks for the memories."
"151|2|I was advised not to go to this location, but I had to try it my self. It's a new location so as expected the Decor is beautiful, but today for the first time I ordered my normal take out choice ""Jamaican black pepper shrimp"" and when I got home to my surprise these cheap bastards gave me half the shrimp I usually get at the Westbury location. It's like they went over they're budget so know I have to sacrifice with my portions. I swear they're isn't a shortage of shrimp in New York so I can't figure out a logical reason for this. What's worse is when I finally decided to eat the food, it was over cooked.First and last time. So disappointed."
152|2|Too many flies... move my table twice .. maybe. Sewer issue  construction trucks with hose going in the basement...
153|2|Worst location when it comes to customer service.The staff at the entrance are so dismissive. I'm shock. Was happy to see a cheese cake factory in the area but now very disappointed.
"154|3|Four stars for the food. It's a chain, so you already know what you're getting. One of my favorites is the garlic creamy pasta - it is sooo delicious and hearty. And, of course, the cheesecake is amazing.The wait for our food was just insane here! On a Wednesday afternoon, after the dinnertime rush, my party of three waited over an hour for our meal - two pasta dishes and a chicken sandwich. Appetizer came out right away, but it just took absolutely forever for our food to come. There was really no apology from the server or anyone else or even any update while we waited. I would have loved to be comped for my Cheesecake for the extremely long wait, but alas, no."
"155|2|I was so completely disappointed which is a shame because the first time I came here, everything was wonderful. Our server was this blonde woman whose name I forgot but was sweet and attentive and made our meal there a great experience. I raved about it to my best friend so we went back with our boyfriends and the server just seemed angry with us. She avoided eye contact and would just toss things at us and practically sprint away. To be fair, we had said we needed 5 extra minutes twice to place our order but that's still not an excuse to mistreat a group of people. She even went to the table right next to us and laughed and smiled at them and then would get to us and drop the niceness and just do everything but sprint away from us. It was honestly so insulting when she flat out ignored my boyfriend who was trying to get her attention to let her know she had made a mistake with the bill. So not only was Erika Mae rude and neglectful, but she couldn't even be bothered to bill us properly! When Elise momentarily took over her shift we had a much better dining experience but then Erika Mae was back and we were literally taken aback at how poorly we were being treated. It was as if we had hurt her long ago and she was getting petty revenge. I don't know what crawled up her ass and died but I know I'm never going back and if anyone gets her as a server, they should request someone else because she cant even claim to have been having a bad day when she was treating everyone else nicely but us."
"156|2|I am so mad, I felt obliged to open an account and share my experience.Today, December 15, 2016 at 5pm I went to this location of the cheesecake factory yo buy a whole cheesecake.It took them 40 minutes! FORTY MINUTES, to be able to give 1 cheesecake.The exact same cheesecake is half the price at the Costco which is 300 feet away!So,if you want to wait 40 minutes to just get a cheesecake to go (I wonder how many weeks would they need if it was a dine-in order) feel free to go.I will continue buying Cheesecake factory's cheesecakes, but I will never go back there.40 minutes for a cheesecake, do not get surprised when you run out of business. Because with that attitude, you won't last long..."
"157|3|The three stars is for the foods only.I am very disappointed with my waitress, very impatient and rude, name starts with N. When she first came over to the table, we want to start ordering the drinks first, we took a few seconds to discuss an alternative because they don't offer what we request. Then she got impatient and said we need more time she will come back, she just left and without giving us any recommendation on the menu. When we told her we are ready to order, she just said ok and left us waiting for another 20minute. That's been 30 minute passed since we sat down. Finally the food came in another half hour, it was two other different servers who serve the food, and they are very nice.When we finished, our waiter came back, we asked for desert, and she started to take the plates away, she took the first plate, and then she have her hand there and waiting for us to hand her the other plate. I'm have never been to a restaurant that a customer have to serve the waiter/waitress.I understand it's a Holiday, and it is busy. But the waitress make me feel like I'm not welcoming at the place, very unprofessional. We still give a 15% tip, only because we don't know if they share the tips. But I really don't think she deserve it."
"158|2|Terrible! my husband and I have come to this establishment since it opened as we live in the area, but today it has been a bad choice to come to this place. 1) it took more than 30 min to get our food order. 2) my salad was full of dressing, it was that crazy that I couldn't finish it. 3) the ""carne asada"" it was just disgusting, rice with no flavor, corn and steak with tons of peppercorns, extremely salty! 4) the service was a disaster to the beginning to the end, we were sitting aprox. 10 min at the bar and they even look at us, we had to call theirs attention to be able to order and after everything when I told the bartender about the food she told me that she could do nothing about it, followed with another wait to pay. 5) manager Andrew, completely useless. After what happened we tried to explain our dissatisfaction and the only thing that he could tell us is that he hopes to gives us a better service next time, what a joke! Definitely after this sour experience, I will not go back to this place, there are millions of restaurants in this area to come here to waste my time, my appetite and my money."
"159|1|I give it four stars simply because the food and atmosphere overall is good. We just made some bad appetizer choices. I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in about 5 years and it hasn't changed much which is a plus for me. I liked the food then and I enjoyed it now. The drinks were weak, needed more liquor but was good but not for $12.50. The server was very nice but not attentive at all. Over it was a good experience and I will return eventually...lol"
"160|1|After reading most reviews I was starting to get disappointed and worry since I wanted a good time dinner for my mom and our friend but I prayed to God and everything was awesome except for the beginning. First when I entered an employee in the front was not friendly, when I approached her to ask her where do I go to get a table for 3, she seemed busy in a computer and she just responded quickly without any eye contact or smile, ""just go up ahead to the lady"". Up ahead obviously wasn't enough detail since I had to ask another employee passing by where can I register for a table for 3 and he pointed to the direction we should go. Finally when I was attended they ask for my name and give you a small rectangle device that vibrates and flashes red lights when your table is ready. I was able to wander inside the mall but only through that first floor and up to jcpenny since the connection of that device only reaches that far. They said that I would wait approximately 30 minutes but I just waited about 15 minutes. The food was great and the virgin Piña Colada had a small different taste than usual but it was still good and the food did not take long to arrive at our table. First our appetizer came quickly which we ordered Fried Calamari and then our entree plates came which my mom and our friend kept saying how great was the new York, well done Steak.The waitress that took care of us was very friendly and attentive to our care and I have no complain of herOverall it was a wonderful experience especially since we sat by the window and could see outside the streets, this area of the restaurant we were placed was a long narrow rectangular shape but it was a cool area too."
161|2|Cheesecake Factory has good food. That cannot be disputed but the service at the queens blvd / queens center mall location is HORRIBLE ! Three different times of horrendous service. To he point where I could've and should've walked out !! I think I will just take the drive and head to Roosevelt field and go to grand Lux !
"162|1|I had an absolutely wonderful time here with Matt and Andrew! Both bartenders were extremely attentive and made sure our glasses were never empty! My mom and I had the guac which we absolutely loved! It was fresh and flavorful! We also had the potstickers, chicken sliders and shrimp spring rolls everything was amazing!! We were hesitant to come since Cheesecake Factory is new to our neighborhood but I have to say I was impressed! Thank you for the great time!!"
163|1|Only posting 5 stars because we had an amazing waitress Melissa. She's awesome and makes the experience great. Other than that the food sucks completely but the cheesecake is bomb. I obviously had the low carb strawberry and it really hit the spot. Will not be back.
"164|2|People were nice, polite and accommodating at least but quite a few mistakes with our meal though. We got ""beet salad with goat cheese"" without any goat cheese; cold fried calamari, with raw batter inside. After a long wait with no entrees, we were told there were no more mashed potatoes and gluten-free pasta and told to pick alternatives. Then when we were ready, wait, the mashed potatoes were done so forget it. Instead of gluten-free pasta, we ordered an omelet but it was dry that I thought the egg was a tortilla. Medium burger came out well-done and ordered ""crispy chicken with cheese"" but was given a grilled one without cheese. The Thai coconut chicken didn't look appetizing especially with the lighting, didn't look as on the menu and didn't taste good. The pineapple chicken didn't have much pineapple and the pasta with it was already dry on the top. Is it bec the food was waiting too long to be brought to the table? Corrections were made but with all the waiting, some people weren't eating and our dinner ended up too long. Ok if comped parking but we had to pay mall parking"
"165|2|My wife, kids and I just walked out shortly after being seated because we were so disgusted.   About 5 minutes after being seated, we were approached by a staff member and was asked to pick up our feet because they wanted to mop some orange vomit like substance off the floor. After a few wipes with a dirty mop it only ended up spreading more of it and that killed our appetite."
"166|1|Great service and atmosphere! Our waiter was super friendly and patient. The food took a while to come, but it's understandable due to Sunday's busy brunch schedule. Loads of food options on the menu :)"
"167|2|Horrible experience! Waited 1hr to get a table, 1hr and half to get the food and 20min to get cheesecake to go. When we were asking where was the food after 40min they kept saying it will be ready in 10min. No one came to us to apologize the long wait we had to ask for the manager which he only said ""it not your fault I will go get your food right now"". Frozen cheesecake, burn food and long wait. So unprofessional, absolutely no sense of costumer service. Everyone here need more training. Never again!"
"168|1|The gods have answered Queens residents' prayers! My friend and I came for lunch on opening day, and we were very impressed with the service and the neatly organized layout. We were told 20 minutes but seated in 10 minutes.Our server was on point and courteous. We didn't want to eat huge entrees, so we ordered 3 small plates/appetizers: chicken samosas, crab bites and the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls. All were great but I liked the crab bites the best. We shared the pumpkin pecan cheesecake, and it was divine. Complimentary warm bread and butter were great too. Yelpers, we no longer have to trek to Long Island."
169|2|Place is trash corporate needs to take a look into this place. The worst part of all of this is that I decided to give it another go because of Cat the server which now I learned Her name is Casterin. Hello corporate guess what this place sucks! Manager Andrew is the worst manger on staff!! Super rude didn't even want to mention I had a problem b4 because of his attitude I just wanted HIM TO GO AWAY!!!!!!!!!!. Plus I don't know if you have a new head manger cause things haven't been the same since January 2017 and 18. I came back because of the great service despite everything else and the server I like CASTERIN wasn't even there.. this place just gets worse and worse. I don't even give places reviews but this place has just been such a disappointment time and time again  besides the serving staff it's ridiculous
170|1|We had a good experience dining here. We came around 2:30pm and it was still pretty crowded but we got seated after 5 mins. The host was nice so as the servers. Nice ambiance too. The food was nice and tasty. The full portion is really big. Will come back here again.
"171|2|Check my Yelp profile-- I rarely ever give any restaurant a 1 star but this Queens Center Mall location is the exception. I am beyond upset with the manager at this establishment. I was seated promptly and then told by the hostess that I ""took a table that wasn't mine"" after she called me, took my buzzer, sat me at the table and distributed the menu to my party. She said there was a party of 7 ahead of me that our table was originally meant for them and I calmly told her I will not get up as this was an error on their part and we are already seated and I'd be happy to discuss this with a manager, thinking that a manager--- you know a well trained staff member in customer service would see this as an opportunity to quickly resolve a small issue. The manager who came up to me did not want to disclose her name to me but she was a woman with dark brown shoulder length hair. She was automatically defensive and condescending telling me that I should have known the table was not mine if my buzzer wasn't vibrating and as soon as I responded with, ""well if that's the case, the fault is on the hostess who is an employee and trained to know the buzzer should have been vibrating when she received it from my hands and proceeded to sit our party at the table."" I didn't even finish my sentence when she literally walked away from me!! Everyone at my table was shocked that this was a ""manager"". The worse part is that this was my birthday dinner (which I somehow managed to tell her before she left me mid-sentence). The only reason I stayed was because the server was mortified, she came over to our table to apologize on behalf of the managers behavior. She listened to me, told me she didn't really know what to do but she'll bring us some water in the meantime. I appreciated her validation that this was totally crazy. I even asked her to call the manger back so we can finish our conversation and I literally watched her go back and the manager refused to come back to our table. She made our server wait 20 minutes before taking our order but in the mean time our server brought us bread and refilled our drinks as needed. I will say this again, the server ELENA was amazing and if it wasn't for her we would have left with my Birthday dinner completely ruined. I will be sharing this review on every forum and Cheesecake contact because this ""manager"" who refused to give me her name and tried to refuse me service should not have a job much less a title as a manager."
172|1|Good experience at the restaurant. I saw 8 people celebrating their birthdays on one night. That's amazing ~~
"173|1|I am so happy that this place has opened up close by. To start off the staff is wonderful, like the best customer service I have ever experienced. Everyone is super friendly and courteous. The place was nice and clean. The food was just perfect. The portions were generous and filling. The chicken madeira really was extraordinary...soft tender and delicious. The appetizers were really large almost a meal by themselves. Overall wonderful experience and so happy such a wonderful restaurant has opened here. From service to food everything was spot on."
"174|1|This was my first experience going to any Cheesecake factory. The location is so convinent and easy to get to. Expecting a long wait, it was only 30 mins for 2 people and a manager walked up to us and said if we want there are two spaces open at the bar. So we were immediately seated which was great! The bartender Terri was really sweet, attentive and courteous. Our long island iced teas were DELICIOUS and she made them with obvious expertise. We were a bit annoying, asking for things like napkins, the menu back and utensils but she got them to us right away.The decor and amtmosphere was really really nice for a chain resturant. I was expecting an applebees type of vibe and it was more of a fancy 5 star in manhatten type of place. The bar was stacked and gorgeous.The mashed potato tots were delicious and the firecracker shrimp was just tiny fried shrinp w a delicious chipotle aioli.I ordered the southern fried catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, green beans and remoulade. Amazing!!! Very large porportions! I got three pieces of fish a healthy serving of mash and the remoulade was fantastic. The absolute star of the night was definitely rhe mac and cheese though!! Me and my friend were raving about it all night. It was cheesy, crispy and flavorful. Honestly AMAZING.The whole experience was really awesome. Great food, service and atmosphere. I will definitely go back."
"175|3|I came here to experience a pre opening dinner. The sever was very attentive but he can work on meal placement. Don't place the drinks on top of the meals and if the appetizers are not finished don't bring the entrees. I had the buffalo blasts for my appetizer which was a different take on a buffalo wing. I recommend having the boneless option. For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo it wasn't bad but the rice was hard. The beer that I was served had a lot of foam, but overall it was not bad."
"176|1|Went one saturday afternoon with my girlfriend and best friend. The three of us had a wonderful time! The food was very good and out waitress was super nice and attentive.Only downside to this place is that the wait can be fucking brutal. We got lucky on our first visit having only a 40 minute wait time. Our second visit, we were told it was going to be 2 hours for a table. Sadly had to walk away from that and order some cheap takeout instead."
"177|1|It's a real good restaurant in ELM.For the environment,service all of them are pretty nice.Recommend the chicken mango avocado salad .But the air conditioner was too cold!LOL ..."
178|2|This place is whack. The servers are nice; but the service is slow. I've noticed that they run out of several items on their menu; despite the fact that those are their most popular items. How does one run out of their more popular items that frequently? Then; there is the portion size of the meals. I once ordered a Factory Burrito; and I was surprised to find out that it's tiny. It pretty much looked like a small fat wrap. Recently; I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Damn; the serving was tiny. It was served on a side dish platter. Perhaps this place is best suited for take out.Honestly; I rather go to the Factory over in Westbury.
179|3|Came here for lunch. I use to love going to their location in Long Island. I didn't like anything I ordered. Everything was too salty.  Best thing about the whole experience was the passion fruit margarita and service.
180|2|Basically:1 hour+ wait for 4 people. Sit down. Just ate cheesecake cuz we went to Shake Shack next door in the meantime. First time. Lunch Sunday.Okay Godiva. Not my favorite but definitely downable bite by bite even by a person who don't like chocolate mousse. Chocolate in the middle pure heaven.
"181|1|I had the most amazing experience at The Cheese Cake Factory! Our server was the perfect definition of customer service! I couldn't have asked for a better person person, thank you so much to Danielle B Table 0353!!!! Shout out to you girl ! I hope we get out every time!"
"182|2|JUST AWFUL! I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations in Long Island and NJ and this by far has to be the absolute worst. This was my 3rd time at this location. 1st time, 2 hour wait and the food was just ok. 2nd time,  an hour long wait, I got the Steak Diane which literally tasted like someone dumped a gallon of salt on it .. and my 3rd, yesterday.. I ordered the chicken & biscuits (had this dish a least 10x before) ... My biscuit was hard and burnt, you could here the clacking sound if I hit my fork on it, then the mash potatoes (if you want to call it that) I had 3 HUGE potato chunks that were not fully cooked ( size of my biscuit) and hardly any gravy. Our waiter who was extremely nice and friendly didn't really try to resolve the problem. He apologized when I showed him everything when he came to collect the plates, but came back with no manager and the full bill. I barely touched anything on that plate. Extremely disappointed and this location is tarnishing the Cheesecake Factory brand."
"183|1|First time at Cheesecake Factory. Hands down wonderful experience, servers Noela and evi were amazing on their attentiveness,professionalism and dedication to my dining experience. Definitely worth checking out. Great job Cheesecake Factory!"
"184|2|Service here is atrocious. Our waitress was very nice but very absentminded. My friends and I placed our order only to have her come back 25 minutes later to claim that she would check with the back to see what was going on. The thing is that we ordered the Seared Tataki Tuna Salad, which shouldn't have taken incredibly long to make. Nonetheless, we watched as other people who came in after us receiving their orders before us. Mind you, we came in about 15 minutes after they opened!The salad was pretty good and refreshing, nothing to write home about but satisfying enough.The menu is crazy long, practically like a book but I immediately flipped to the cheesecake section. My friends and I went for the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and that was honestly the only highlight of our visit. That one slice of cheesecake could be split between 2 people!! It was just so creamy and the salted caramel layer at the top balanced the cream cheese portion nicely. I loved that the crust was nice and moist too! And the fact that there was little flakes of salt to provide that extra crunch was the cherry on top.A little side note: I asked the waitress to bring out the cheesecake as soon as she took my plate away because we were running late on time. She came back to the table to collect everyone else's dishes 10 minutes later and asked if we had placed an order for the cheesecake already. Service is definitely lacking here. Such a disappointment. Come for the cheesecake but be prepared to be very patient if you order entrees too."
"185|2|Honestly this review is for my past experience like long time ago. Come across this restaurant on yelp so I want to share my experience. It was packed and I wait about an hour which is fine that they told me already, however, after seated we waited long time to get served and then the waiter disappeared. We finally gets our appetizer and were enjoyed the food. Waiter come and Told us they change shift and intro a new waitress will serve us. Which at that Time I already ordered main course. Guess what happen next, we wait an hour that we thought they are busy and I'm kind person who doesn't like to rush people, and I saw tables coming after us finished their food already and our waiters is nowhere to be seen.  And I finally get someone to find out waitress, she has no idea what I ordered or the order were never put into process. I was so piss and they get the manager, all they do just put your order on the top of line and make you wait. I'm so hungry and mad and leaves the restaurant!"
"186|1|Top restaurant 1st place of Cheesecake! There are definitely hard choices to make when deciding weather to eat, drink and or just dessert. It's always hard for me to choose. Good luck to you! I must extend my Appreciation to a Hostess name Danielle that was working this evening, and having a sharp vision. There was another Hostess who offered, and acted as if she was concerned about my seating. I told her I was thinking of take out and I said let me see. I stepped one foot towards the delicious dessert menu which is a big billboard. I pulled my foot back, looked at the Hostess and said I'm ready to be seated. A woman, and her daughter walked and was literally by my side, and stated "" I'm looking for a table for two "". As previously stated I was speaking with the Hostess before the woman walked up. The Hostess  began engaging in a full conversation with this woman, and reaching to pick up menus as she was saying I have a table for you. It was at this point when Danielle asked me "" Excuse me are you being helped "" I  stated "" I sure thought I was, and I asked Danielle did you just see that, and she answered Yes. I was extremely glad she witnessed  this, and lead us to ours seats first. The food was fantastic as usual. As we were exiting I had to ask Danielle her name and Once Again Thank her for noticing what her co worker was doing. I sincerely hope The Cheesecake Factory realize she certainly handled The Situation Quickly and Professionally. I Believe she saw the Instant Anger, and I was about to Explode. Thanks Again Danielle! A FEW OF THESE STARS ARE FOR HAR AS WELL!"
"187|1|Great food, and most importantly the service was wonderful. All though the wait was an hour and 20 min, but it was expected. Great place , definitely worth going. You don't want to miss out!Food: Greek Salad, it was great. Fried zucchini was alright, not the greatest, the smell of it irritated me, but it was okay.Margarita pizza, delicious.Alfredo pasta, it was alright."
188|1|I've been here a few times since they opened including lunch for my daughter's birthday. Great service and food is exactly the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. Yes it does get crowded but that's expected for a mall restaurant.
189|2|Never thought people who work in restaurants could be so malicious to other human beings. Went here with a guy last night to have dinner. Orders garlic pasta with shrimps. As i am eating my food I bit down on something hard. Don't know what it was. Then I ask the waitress to package my food to take home. Here I am about to dig in to my cheese cake and look WTF I see.. a big portion of cheesed cake dug out . I am so disgusted and confused. Like why why would you want to do something so evil and wicked to someone who you don't know. Who has never done anything to you. I promise you I will never go back here. Trust and believe the manager will be hearing from me.
"190|1|Went here with my mom for dinner before a show. Thought we had some time to kill and ordered steak tacos. Right after we order mom checks the tickets again and realizes our show is at 7pm rather than 8pm. Cue panic. We suddenly have one less hours. Thank god Tim was our waiter. We explained the situation (having only order moments before) and he hopped to it. We got out right on time. I so appreciate his attention to detail and care in handling our needs. I know how much it must suck to have a table suddenly have very strict time constraints but he was so sweet and wonderful about the whole thing.My only wish is that they made reservations, I called today so mom and I could have a less rushed experience here and apparently seating is on arrival. Maybe it would drop the wait time some of there were reservations available.Also, the steak tacos were INCREDIBLE. They deserve their own review!"
"191|3|A cheesecake spot in New York that doesn't make their cheesecakes on sight and no one at the restaurant is quite sure where exactly they are made.  Florida, maybe?  Then again, what do you expect at a chain like this?  Go elsewhere.  You're in New York.  If you're here, get the Reese's peanut butter cup cheesecake slice.  It's good.  The Shepard's pie is pretty good too."
"192|1|Have not been into a Cheesecake Factory since moving to New York City just over a year ago. After looking at Yelp reviews I was a little unsure of what to expect. I'm happy to say that my experience was delightful. For our low key anniversary dinner we order two Proseccos, appetizers, and the very tasty Steak Diane. Emily was such a wonderful server. She made our cheesecake dessert extra special in the way she brought it to the table. Koodos"
193|1|Went for my birthday dinner and loved it! It gets crowded so you might have to wait a bit to get seated. They don't do reservations but it's well worth the wait! The menu is extensive and an endless list of choices! Amazing food and service! Loved it.
"194|3|We waited about an 40 min to be seated, which is normal for any Cheesecake Factory especially on a Friday night. I got the bistro shrimp pasta and my friend got the eggplant Parm. Portions are HUGE as usual and filling. Food came about 15 minutes after we ordered which isn't bad, considering how busy they usually are. Will be back!"
"195|2|Do not order DoorDash!!! Do not do take home!!!! Trust me!!! Where do I start?  I have eaten at this location a few times and the experiences have been great!  I decided to order through DoorDash a Sunday afternoon.  I expect the food to not be hot... it's delivery in NY-traffic- one way streets, 2 miles takes about 25 minutes! But to be missing items, a whole meal and when I call the manager Andrew (which didn't want to provide his last name or initial), he could not help us! He said that they have a contract with DoorDash and they are not responsible! I call DoorDash, it's an automated system and the number is no longer in service once you received your meal! So my daughter's meal never arrived and had to go get another meal for her around the corner!!! I really thought Cheesecake would get it right! They usually good about it but there is always a manager that doesn't follow the principles of the company and think that it's their own business! Shame on you!  Unbelievable!!! Yes 6 days later waiting on the items missing"
"196|1|This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and it will not be my last. I enjoy the food,drinks and service. The waitress was very helpful, she showed my girlfriend and I the best service we have ever had at a restaurant. The drinks that we ordered were perfect, strong and enjoyable. I would recommend this place to everyone."
"197|1|Love ordering these guys on DoorDash! The menu is so extensive, and everyone can always get what they want."
"198|2|Went to the Cheesecake Factory last night, host were great, food was great, but my server Henry was lacking. Service was absolutely terrible to the point where I don't think I'll be coming back to this location. I'd rather drive 45 minutes to the one in Westbury because that's how bad my service was last night which says a lot because I come to this location a lot because my past servers have been absolutely great."
"199|3|80 minute wait for okay food and super slow service. The waitress, Amanda P., was awesome! Super nice and very helpful. That's the only reason this place gets 3 stars."
"200|1|I only visited this place twice:  a month ago on a regular day when there was almost no one at the cashier's, and the second time a week ago on a day that happened to be a national cheesecake day or something. Maaan, that was the queue I havenot seen since the black Friday. However, could not leave the place without my tiramisus. They are very nice there. They offer the cheesecake version and the origianal one. I go for the latter. I took the cakes away with me,  but the place is quite nice  to stay and eat there.Definitely going back to the place for more tiramisu."
"201|2|I got a free cheesecake for buying their gift card during the holiday so I redeemed it just 3 days ago. I got a piece of Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch cheesecake to go. The first thing I noticed is that they changed the box for the cake. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with it being a piece of free cake. The box was obviously too low for the whole cake to fit in, so the cashier had to push the lid down and squeeze the cake to fit. When I got home the cake looks like a piece of shit. Not only that, the cake was also not fresh. The cake at the very bottom is overly dry and this is not the first time I had this cake, so I know it shouldn't be that way. Like the other reviewer said, I'm done with Cheesecake Factory."
202|2|Went here for my friends birthday dinner on Friday night.. short wait time..food was mediocre (had to send food back). Beautiful atmosphere though.
203|1|Great place to have lunch but dinner gets really busy with sometimes a two hour wait!  So get there early if possible. Great food with a very large menu with tons of selections and great service.
"204|2|Second time there.. Our toast was BLACK on one side, of course black side down. All brunch plates came out at different times, service sucked. Also, we didn't get our side of potatoes which the waitress asked us if we wanted upon returning if  because ""it was supposed to come with the entree."" Third time there.. This Sunday we went for a birthday party of 12 ended up being 10, the waiter had a melt down when we shifted over one seat. Not. kidding. It took an hour and 10 minutes for our breakfast to come.. BREAKFAST. Management clearly isn't doing something correctly with their hiring process and the kitchen is way too slow. If you come here sit with Talisha!! We had her the first time we went to this location and she was the best."
"205|1|So I'm going to update this review ... literally am taking one star away for the fact that the rule of ""one drink per customer at a time"" is BULLSH**T I finished my last sip of Chardonnay the second he walked away , food arrived almost ate half and wine still wasn't here. Waited and waited now foods cold and still no wine. ?! Don't understand. Service is outstanding and food is honestly delicious. Bryan's awesome and I know he's following store policy. He's probably the best server I've had here and this is about my 6th time at this location. I have ordered the loaded tater tops multiple times but this time I just wasn't feeling them. Maybe I ate them too many times (LOL) I got the Farfalle (but substituted penne) and it was honestly absolutely DELICIOUS. but I am upset about the wine situation .. fix that guys . Thanks ... sincerely your semi regular --- chris ..... PS Bryan's customer service is so good and he is just killing it here for real ... would love him come work for me !!!"
"206|3|Very nice location, but I don't dare think I'd try my luck at getting a table in under an hour. The cheesecake is divine, and usually takes 15-30 minutes to get a to go slice depending on the day and time you drop by.A valid tip for those who are planning to visit; do expect to wait, and don't blame the staff for how long it takes to seat! they can't rush patrons out, so when they apologize and say they're doing their best, don't be rude and hasty because it's not their fault. I've been here about 6 times so far for cheese cake pick ups for my coworkers, and each time there's an argument about something inevitable. Everyone's excited about this place, so expect the wait that comes with it! Also, to the woman who says a piece of her slice was eaten, it looks like a tiny piece came off a connected slice lol. I don't think anyone would go through weeks of training to blow their job over something like that."
"207|1|I came here the day before Valentine's day around 9ish so granted,the place was full. The wait on tables was about 10 minutes so it wasn't so bad. The interior decoration is lovely and the cocktail list seems well put together. Our food was pretty good,the Filet Mignon was so tender,it was like butter in your mouth! However,we had to wait long for our food and the mash potatoes were undercooked. Our server was so understanding! She was a bit overworked but she still found time to be attentive and ofcourse,the cheesecakes were amazing!"
"208|1|I sat at the bar for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised. I don't usually go to chain restaurants because the quality of food and drinks isn't where I'd like it to be. A ratchet friend of mine begged me to come, and come for happy hour I did. The drinks were ok, but at $6 Per drink you aren't getting a complaint from me. The food is what blew me out of the water. I had the Ahi tartar, which was wayyy better than I was expecting. It was fresh, and came with avocado and a nice soy ginger sauce. The avocado rolls and chicken sliders were also pretty good, but the burger is what surprised me the most. It was juicy and perfectly seasoned. I looked around the joint like, ""where am I? Is this really the Cheesecake Factory??"" The bartender wasn't too sociable, which I'm perfectly okay with. As long as you grab my order and the food comes out in a timely manner, I'm good. Anyway, definitely recommend for happy hour which is from 4-6."
"209|2|I had only 30-45 min to spend on dinner, I set at the bar and ordered a vegetable salad and a glass of wine. I specifically asked for my dressing to be on a side. When the salad arrived ( relatively quick) the dressing was on it  The bartender was very nice, he apologized, took the salad  and said the new salad will be out shortly. The salad arrived and it was missing edamame, radicchio and cucumbers ( annoying) I let a new bartender now about that. He apologized and said that missing items will be out shortly. The missing items arrived, I dumped them in my salad, then realized that edamame was frozen. The manager was called ( a nice young lady) she apologized as well and brought out warm microwaved edamame. I was confused ( what do you expect me to do with frozen edamame that are already mixed in my salad? ) she said I will get you a new one. At this point I don't have time to eat anymore. She said I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. I asked her to put it to-go. She also graciously gave me a piece of cheesecake( that I didn't really care for) . But when my bill arrived I was surprised to see a salad was still on the bill. I paid and left It is not about money but more about customer service. My order was messed up 3 times!!!!! And I left hungry. It's not a great experience. I was very disappointed"
210|2|Very slow service. Staffs are busy but inefficient. Needs 20' for being served. Needs 30' for getting some bread. Very low class restaurant.
211|1|Dre is an amazing server and is the primary reason we come to Cheesecake Factory! He always makes great recommendations and always delivers exceptional service. Definitely will be coming back !
"212|1|Went there for my birthday with my family and had a fantastic meal and a spectacular dessert, it was a Monday and totally packed but after my meal I understand why"
"213|1|Was in the neighborhood yesterday with my family looking for a place to have breakfast and my 9 year old son who loves The Cheesecake Factory suggested we go for Sunday brunch. The food was amazing as always and our server Chantel was a pleasure. She recommended the brûlée french Toast so both my husband and I had it. So glad we took her advice, it was heavenly. Our 4 kids really enjoyed their brunch as well."
214|2|The service was here was absolutely terrible. It took about an hour before I got my meal in front of me and the waitress who was serving us clearly had no interest in doing her job properly. The food was mediocre at best. I should have listened to the other reviews and gone somewhere else.
"215|1|Exquisite ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"". My all-time favorite! What I come for each time. They don't do it wrong here. They really strive for perfection. I also had the ""Avocado Eggrolls"" for appetizer. It was certainly fresh and tasteful. They use avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper. The tamarind-cashew dipping sauce adds a flavorful touch to say the least and I would add that it's just right with its saltiness. The atmosphere here is intimate and relaxing! Service is commendable. It's high time NYC got its own Cheesecake Factory spot. I'm very grateful. Good job, guys!"
"216|3|Fiancé took me to the Cheesecake Factory as a birthday surprise since I have always wanted to come here but never had a chance because of situations back then.wasn't that long of a wait,our waitress was funny & made us felt welcome I wish I remembered her name (I would recommend her).they have a big menu,covering about everything.i was a bit surprised and felt my order should have been more but it tasted good.would definitely come back again."
"217|2|This Cheesecake Factory located in the Queens Center Mall is an embarrassing representation for the franchise. We started with drinks and my fiancé ordered a passion fruit mojito and I ordered the peach Bellini. Both drinks were really good but I liked my fiancé mojito a little more because I could actually taste the alcohol. My fiancé ordered the chicken bellagio which our server, Jordan discouraged him from getting because he said it did didn't have any flavor and recommended the parmesan chicken. I ordered a favorite of mine the chicken stuffed tortillas.  At least 30 minutes had passed and Jordan hadn't checked on us or asked us if we wanted more drinks and we still didn't have our food so my fiancé ask for him to check on it. Jordan brings my chicken stuffed tortillas first then my fiancé chicken Bellagio. My fiancé food looks right but mine looks like it's missing something. I noticed the sweet corn cakes are missing from the plate. I ask our server, JordanWhere are the corn cakes. He looks at me with a confused expression. He said that is what you ordered. I said I know, but it's missing the corn cakes that give the dish that sweet with savory balance. The waiter just kept the dazed and confused look, so I asked him to bring me a menu. He comes back with the menu and starts trying to look through the menu to find it. I told him to give it to me because I know exactly what page it was on. When I turned to the page and pointed to the details of the dish where it list what's in it, the waiter doesn't even look at the menu instead he walks away... yes you read correctly. I point to where it says corn cakes and this guy just walks away. There happens to be another waiter, Tyrone cleaning up a table beside us and I ask him if the chicken stuffed tortillas comes with corn cakes and he said yes it does. Tyrone is the star of this story because he apologized for our bad service even though he wasn't even our waiter. This restaurant doesn't deserve you. A manager I want to call Jessica comes out and says sorry we don't have any corn cakes would you like something else. Wtf? I wouldn't have ordered this dish if I would have known that. She said I'm sorry I just found out. She said I can give you a minute to think about it. It had taken so long just to get the food I didn't want to wait in that cold restaurant waiting for any more disappointment. Our waiter, yes that idiot that lacked social grace came to my fiancé and asked if he was keeping his food. That's how it is Jordan,really? First you was recommending food then something goes wrong with my dish and you don't even say I'm sorry the meal wasn't complete or I'm sorry I didn't check on you guys before we got the food or after. The manager comes back out, I tell her I don't want anything just take care of my fiancé meal. The managerJessica by the way is not rude, but she is basic. Basic customer service, basic concern with a lot of basic staff. (She first was just going to offer me cheesecake for my trouble) lol. We asked Jordan for a box for my fiancé food and this fool actually said I thought you said you didn't want it. Now I'm pissed. We explained the manager comped his meal and I said it's not your concern anyway seeing as you didn't do anything to resolve the situation. He looks at me and says how come, I didn't make the food I just brought it out. I told him that it's not that there was an error that makes him responsible it's because he never admitted there was a mistake, he walked away when I showed him there was something missing and didn't say anything(weird) and he walked around us like I did something wrong even though my meal was wrong. I said in the future instead of trying to give your unsolicited advice on food we should order make sure you learn how to effectively communicate to customers their order will be incomplete and learn strategies in how to best resolve issues when problems arise. At the very least most waiters will say I'm sorry we didn't have what you ordered correct or I apologize that you were disappointed with your meal.. See Jordan, simple. This is by far the WORST Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. From the wait time to get the food, bad management, to incompetent servers, this Cheesecake Factory location is a fail. Also the other manager Katie who describes herself as a second tier manager... yes sweetheart you are definitely second tier. Your sarcastic tone and unfriendly disposition fits quite perfectly in this second tier establishment. Tyrone even though you were not my waiter nor management you showed more professionalism and class than all other parties mentioned above. Yes, it did mean a lot to us  that you apologized for the bad experience."
"218|2|Service was bad.Servers takes too long to bring drinks to take orders.Took almost an hour to get our main course.It takes them forever even to get bill.Oh my oh my, so sad.Food was ok, i guess thats the semi good part."
"219|1|I had such a great time here.. you must get a table with Manny! I couldn't believe the service. He was so knowledgeable- the menu can be intense. And he helped us find the best cheesecake. (Omg, I was so full) Thank you Manny! If you have a great server to guide you, this place is great!!! You need to have good server here. The menu is large and not everything is good."
"220|1|Cool, comfortable intimate environment with beautiful interior, this place always ranks at the very top of the list no matter which of of their locations I try. The food is always outstanding and reasonably priced. Be prepared for a wait during peak hours, but it's well worth it!"
"221|2|Worse experience ever they are sooo slow, the food has no flavor at all I being to other cheesecake factory and never had such a bad experice will never go back."
"222|2|Disappointed, we approximately spent 3 to 4 hours in there. To just get our food took an hour if not more and when we finally got our food the plates were extremely hot and I burned my hand. It was not what we were expecting. The server that took our order came to our table literally 3 times didn't even offer us water or came to see if our food was ok. The only good thing were the cocktails. P.s bathroom lights are way too low it was so hard to do a diaper change."
"223|2|The worst experience by far. I ordered a steak and it was way overcooked. It was like eating cardboard. Ordered the buffalo chicken appetizer, it was disgusting. Went to the restroom and all three stalls had no toilet paper. The only plus was our server and the Asian lettuce wrap. Consider what this place charges what a big disappointment."
224|2|So my family and I decided to go here because we were shopping for my nieces school clothes and my boyfriend has never been here so we went.... I wish we would have gone to the food court because the experience we had was absolutely horrible... we waited 20 minutes which is fine because it's expected but my boyfriend went to the bar to get a beer and after waiting 10 minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge that he was sitting there (he was the only one at the bar BTW) he decided to join us in waiting so they finally called us and we sat and waited 20 minutes for a server to come over and she mentioned she is not our server but she felt sorry for us that we have been waiting there for so long that she came over.... ok took our drink orders and appetizer orders which took 15 minutes to get our drinks but my 4 year old niece waited 15 minutes for apple juice and when we finally got our nachos they were cold... by the way we never even got bread for starters no silverware NOTHING... we were treated like we were a bother at this point my boyfriend was so disappointed his hunger went away and he decided he didn't want anything anymore... our waiter finally arrived and told us sorry for him being late he was called into the office to get yelled at blah blah blah we then said we were unhappy with the service and don't want the nachos or anything so he called his manager over and he came over we complained he apologized and asked if we wanted our nachos reheated... we decided to order my niece food because she was saying how starving she was.... needless to say we spent 2 hours in this place asked for the check and was still charged for the nachos we sent back and didn't want... this place absolutely sucks and the service and MANAGER was even worst.... go to the food courts you'll enjoy it more... wish I can give this zero stars
"225|1|Been here a few times and food and service has been good..Im not sure why there so many bad reviews, but ive only been there during the day when there not busy..Good spot."
226|2|Wait time was 30 min on a Saturday.  Not bad at all.  Waited 15 min for all our food (table of four).  I personally ordered Buffalo strips which came cold.  Took 30 min to to have a manager come (which I never requested) and he told me my food would be here in 5 min.  I told him I did not want it any longer and to remove it from the bill.  He said he will wrap it up to go as if insisting I not have it removed from the bill.  I told him it makes no sense and is unfair to have me wait 35 minutes for food and eat it at the table after everyone has eaten their food.  He offered nothing else except a forced apology.  When the bill came I was charged twice for something I did not have in addition to something that the new waiter put by accident.  We were never told of a switch in waiters either.  Will never come here again.
227|2|Well unless you want to wait 1:30hr to be sitting. No enough seat to wait.Them place is 2 small n dark. 2 many restaurants around to  waiste time n this one. Good luck.
"228|1|Visited this location today, really nice, everyone was courteous and very sweet.  Food was excellent!!  Loved the Shrimp Scampi!! Wait time was very reasonable - will visit again!!!"
229|2|I ordered the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad. Took over 30 minutes to get the order filled and this is what I received.
230|2|DO NOT come to this Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at 7:30 and it's 10:09 and we still do not have a table. When we arrived we were told the wait would be 1 hour or an hour and a half. 2 hours later we're still waiting. Let's be honest the service and food and Cheesecake Factory do not deserve a 2.5 hour wait nor the attitude from the front desk person and the manager that can't explain why we've waited so long. After over a 2.5 hour wait we ended split up among two tables and the bar. Shitty shitty service. Avoid. If no stars could be awarded I wouldn't award any.
"231|2|Whatever you do PLEASE do NOT come here , This place is horrible from the waiter service all the way to the end trying to get your bill to pay , I will start from the start , the waiter had a wrinkled shirt which I could not bare to look at , he then brought over 2 glasses of room temperature water with no ice keep in mind it was 86 degrees outside ! We were reviewing the menu 20 minutes,  no site of this waiter , he arrived we placed our order for a few appetizers and drinks , we requested the bread which is on the House , he stated they ran out of bread ! 30 minutes pass by and no drinks or appetizers, finally we received our appetizer which were the egg roll sampler they were ok . The drinks were watered down taste like lemonade , we ordered a mango and avocado salad that took 45 minutes , once  that arrived it was a soggy salad with no avocado and a horrible presentation, I requested for the bill and this entire lunch experience took 3 hours , I was surprised they did not want to bring me my check after I requested and waited 10 minutes , this place is horrible , don't go to the Cheesecake Factory , go to the one in Long Island it's amazing"
"232|1|The wait is fucking ridiculous. But the food is very good for the price. Our waiter was very polite and helpful. We had the clam chowder, steak Diane, and spicy chicken chipotle pasta. All very good"
"233|1|We went here on a Thursday night. I had the whiskey smash. It was really good I had 2 of them. We had 3 appetizers. Stuffed mushrooms, mini crab cakes and a stuffed potatoes i think they were. All were very good. For my entree i had the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp. Reeeeally tasty. You can have it with white or brown rice. Their portions are big. My kids had to take some home. The nachos is definitely enough for 2 people. We will go again. The service was good. Im bad with names but she was very nice"
"234|2|I got some bring home cheesecake from this location after an otherwise fine meal, and when I got to eat it tonight I was surprised to find it was riddled with walnuts when they did not say it did, even though I am allergic to walnuts and asked for no nuts throughout my meal. Very disappointed and now having a reaction. Shocked they would be so careless."
"235|2|Found something in my food. I ordered a fried macaroni ball with some spaghetti sauce or something. Ended up chewing a lot more then necessary until I realized I'm not chewing on food. (Look at the pic) I told the waitress, she was the bomb btw. She called the manager and the manager said do you want to to get you another appetizer? So I said no. And then she just walked away. She didn't even apologize, she didn't even make us want to stay or come back. She had red or burgundy hair and she was white. Maybe if we were white she would of paid for attention to us. I am not the one to post reviews talking doo doo but I had to because she was such a inconsiderate unprofessional ""manager""? The waitress that took care of us deserves to be manager more then her to be honest. From this experience I will NEVER come back. Hope this help some of you readers."
236|2|This is the worst experience I have ever had.  Not only did I spend 85+ for an ok meal but towards the end while my kids ate dessert I went to the restroom and had to hear two adults having sex in the next stall.  I flushed and they stopped. I quickly got up washed my hands and while existing they continued to have sex.  I proceeded to tell the manager how disappointed I was and also that my family was near the restroom which at any point the would've been able to set the two adults walk out.  He told me there's nothing he can do.  At this point I told him this would be the last time I eat at the cheesecake factory. he proceeded to say well I'll comp your next meal. What an insult to customers especially ones like myself which go out to there establishment many times before. I'm very disappointed in management staff and security.  Me and my family won't ever go there again.  And when I mean family I mean primary family extended family friends and co workers.  How would you feel if it were your child walking into a restroom and here what I heard total discuss
"237|2|I ordered the SALMON and instead I got served SALMONELLA. I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the FIRST and LAST time today, at this specific location and I ended leaving LIVID. I came to this establishment in which I ordered the ""The Herb Crusted Salmon"". I expected my entree to be FULLY COOKED but to my SURPRISE, my entree WASN'T even FULLY COOKED. First and foremost if it wasn't for ME being as attentive to my food and being an individual who actually picks through their food when they go out to eat, I wouldn't had caught this DANGEROUS problem with my food. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should a customer be served  RAW/RARE/ UNDERCOOKED food especially POULTRY & FISH. I came to this establishment ordering and expecting FULLY COOKED SALMON not SASHIMI. I understand that sometimes people make mistakes but seriously NOT THROUGHLY cooking SALMON is RIDICULOUS and a very DANGEROUS mistake to make indeed. Imagine the HELL I would've been going through within 24-48 hours because of someone's careless mistakes. Possibly could've ended up in the ER for food poisoning and I already suffer from a gastrointestinal disease. Consuming improperly handled food with my disease can make me 10 times sicker then the average person if I would've consumed it. This is the EXACT reason why I pick through and I am attentive with my food. Even the waiter the agreed that the Salmon wasn't ""COOKED"".  Salmon isn't even all that difficult to cook, also chefs should be THROUGHLY inspecting the food that is being prepared before putting it up to the pass to give to the server for the guest. Although the waiter did give me the option to re-fire the entree I refused because for one it's salmon, it shouldn't have to be re-fired it's not a steak that wasn't cooked correctly and also if you couldn't cook correctly the FIRST TIME how can I expect you to cook it correctly the second time. I CAN'T TRUST THAT. Moving forward I will NOT be returning to this ESTABLISHMENT."
"238|2|Service was terrible, gave us bad drinks, and food was awful. They were so slow overall. Has the nerve to ask for tip. Don't recommend this awful place!Updated review:Forget this place completely. This location brings shame to Cheesecake Factory in other places. They don't have any appetizers or entrees we want and when we ordered other entrees and appetizers they were oily and tasted old. The drinks are seltzer water basically. Close this place down for the love of god."
239|2|Very disappointed with the food but the service is great ! Not as fancy as the place looks but everyone was very nice not rude at all !
"240|2|I came here once before for dinner and waited over an hour for service. Thought I would give it another try for brunch today. TERRIBLE.  We got here early to avoid the rush and ordered our brunch at 11:15am. By 12:00pm we still had no food and no contact from our waitress, our coffee and tea were cold.  So I flagged her down and was told ""we're waiting for eggs"".  Confused, we asked, ""what do you mean you're waiting for eggs?""   She didn't really give us an answer and walked away and the manager came over a few minutes later to tell us they don't have eggs, They are waiting for them. :"
"241|2|So we were looking for something to do during the holiday and decided to stop in to Cheesecake Factory in the Queens Center Mall.  We had never gone there so it was exciting to be in the area.  Lots of families, shopping and smiling faces.  My partner quickly went in to try to get us a seat.  There was a 20 minute wait which is very usual for this entity.  When we get called, we go to the table and the hostess stopped us short, ""oh it hasn't been cleaned...please wait here"" so I waited with my 2 year old itching to get free, standing behind a family of eight(8) who had just been served trying to eat their food. ""look away"" I tell myself....its rude..Anyway - the hostess returns, 3 minutes or so later and says ok - its ready.  So we plop down and wait.  Maybe 5 minutes or so a server appears.  ""hey, has anyone acknowledged your table?"" , we look ""uh- no"" ; he deep sighs ""okay, then ill be your server""  like he was doing us this favor.  We emphatically replied ""OK!"" Im going to cut to the chase with this, story.  He was clearly overworked with too many tables then started calling my partner ""brother"" toward the end...I was thinking ""is this for the tip""  lol  he doesn't have to do all that.   He was truly a NICE guy and good server too (ok fine yes he was also hot looking), but he was also new and the restaurant was busy.  He forgot my flatware, napkin, my babys entrée, my drink, the plates for bread, the bread, to offer dessert..but he got it together.   Its not totally his fault - he didnt have a backing him up.  Ultimately -  Slowly but surely he took care of us  - and even provided a sample of cucumber lemonade.  I will say - in Washington, DC the Wisconsin Avenue location is much bigger and much if not more busy and this has NEVER happened.  Still in all  the absolute worst part of this entire experience was - THE FOOD!  The firecracker  salmon rolls were greasy as I don't know what, they served it with a head of regular cabbage eh....they ran out of fried shrimp so my partner had to figure out some other dish..(we learned this wayy after we put our order in). the mac and cheese I ordered for my baby had no cheese in it.  It had some cheese coating at the bottom of the bowl...I had to stir it up and it was still dry.   I asked for grilled chicken strips on top.  They provided chicken chunks (about 6) in the mac and cheese.  I was not paying for that.  The server didn't argue.  My salmon and asparagus was good, but the mashed potatoes had a piece of potato that wasn't properly boiled inside..My partner had the Jamaican Black Shrimp.  All that money TCF makes and they didn't put large shrimp in this dish? Weird...and cheap.   Did I mention we had to wait an extra five minutes to eat because my babys food wasn't served with ours? Cucumber lemonade tasted (great).  or that the bread ""was in the oven"" and we had to wait.  All the while im thinking - cmon man, at least have the bread ready.During our meal a Hostess came back to seat someone next to us when our neighbors left.  Same thing happened. (table was dirty)  But instead of being ushered off to the side they stood over the table while she wiped the table off onto the floor...again no flatware...nothing......I also noticed  many tables complaining to the manager.  In fact - when  I went to the bathroom I could see in the kitchen someone was wearing a dangling chain preparing food (hows that for unsanitary)I hate to present problems without solutions so I will give my highest recommendation that TCF corporate get in there and retrain the house staff or change the managerial staff completely.  The back and front of the house is a mess.   It is very poorly managed and it shows in daily operations and in the food.  Ultimately degrading the brand so many have come to love.Do not eat here."
"242|2|Horrible service. I arrived at 6:30 pm with a party of 8 to celebrate my mother's birthday. We weren't seated until 7:30. We didn't receive the appetizer until 8:15 and the entrees came at 9:00 pm   Our server Lamar forgot to come back and check in on us. He saw me struggling to get a selfie group photo and didn't even offer to take a picture. My daughter's chicken fingers were burnt. My mother's food was served cold. My step father""s steak was medium rare not medium well the way he requested. We had to wait so long for water refills. It seemed our waiter had too many tables. It really was the worst Cheesecake Factory experience we have ever had. And today is my mother's birthday. The worst experience. Oh, to top it off, we saw a roach crawling out of the booth. I told the manager and they comped the meal. We left. No birthday cake. Just left."
243|1|you just can't go wrong with cheesecake factory! great service great food
"244|2|Ok , not a place for steaks , not a place for Italian . I think this place has an identity crisis. Serves everything but nothing . We ordered steak , I like themMedium , got a burnt steak , messed up my side as well . Ordered corn got beans ... funny , they don't even rhyme to make a mistake . They redid my steak , mind u I had to wait another 15 mins n nibble from my family's dishes . The steak was perfectly cooked thins time but I have to say , it was the most flavorless steak I be had in my life !!My wife's chicken Marsala was the same story , dry , with no sauce , flat pieces of chicken . My daughter ordered lemon garlic chicken , equally bland . My mai tai was a saving grace . Margaritas forget about it . My wife who happens to be a margarita aficionado hates her top shelf ultimate margarita as well so much so that she ordered sugar syrup lol . Buy their cheesecake to go !! Go home n enjoy , don't waste your time here !"
"245|2|The service was awful! The wait was over an hour long, which wasn't the issue, and the waiters and waitresses had no idea what they were doing. After being seated and assigned a waiter, Ian, I placed my order. I waited over 55 minutes to receive my order and in the mean time there was no sign of Ian. Some random guy came over and said my food would be ready a little while longer and thanked me for my patience. 2 other random waitresses delivered my food and again there was no sign of a waiter thereafter. I had to find someone to request my bill. She disappeared after I got my bill and another woman picked up my bill. After sitting for  25 minutes to get my card back I asked the woman who took my card to return it and she was confused as if she had no idea who i was. She left to find whomever had my card and I left after being there for 3 hours!!! I would NEVER go back there!!!!"
"246|3|Visited the cheesecake factory with my mom and daughter last sunday afternoon,i will say  the ambiance was nice. The wait wasn't too long to be seated so thats a plus. I was in the mood for pasta and shrimp, It's important to know exactly what you want or in the mood for because  they have a large menu. I settled on the shrimp and sausage pasta, it was very flavorful but the portion was small. There wasn't enough sausage if you ask me. The mojito was ok. My daughter's  pizza seems fine as she didn't complain. Our waiter was ok, refilled drinks without being asked, checked on us once maybe twice. Overall it was good."
247|2|Terrible service and long waits for food as we asked for gluten free pasta. My meal came out cold and server was bossy and rude. Wouldn't come back again
"248|2|I have been to Cheesecake Factory before but this time is the worst by far and last straw. Never again will I want to go to a Cheesecake Factory.1. Waited a while and no water. Since I was thirsty I asked the waitress again for water. Waitress said will be right back with water then proceeded to take orders for the table next to us, enter the orders, and not show up for a while.2. The appetizer arrived before the water and drinks. I had to wait another several minutes before water and drinks arrived. Ended waiting for like 20 minutes for water and drinks. That is just ridiculous!3. Waitress forgot to place our entree orders. Realized it when she came back 10 minutes later to ask what we wanted to order.4. Overall, long wait for the food. Appetizer came on time then waited over 30 minutes for entrees. 5. Calamari appetizer was kind of good because of the marinara sauce but nothing memorable or worth getting again.6. Shepherd's pie was very bad in taste and looks. It looked like a dark mess and was appetite ruining to look at. Tasted odd and overly salty. It was more like a marsala. There were burnt bits in it, of I don't know what. Most of it was not finished.7. Shrimp scampi was 40% good 60% bad. The shrimp was very good, cooked just right, nice crisp, and just right flavoring. The pasta tasted like lemon+sugar and nothing else. Half the pasta was not finished.8. Gumbo was 50% good. Broth base taste was good and mixed well with the rice. The chicken was overcooked and dry, with most of it left over. The shrimp was also overcooked but edible. Also found burnt charred bits of I don't know what in it. Half of it was left over because no longer had appetite to finish.Really was looking forward to have some cheesecake but not going to happen after the terrible service and food we had. We arrived at 9:40ish pm, waited about one hour to be seated, and finished about 11:50pm. Overall, about two hours spent for the meal and it was almost a complete waste of time. ."
"249|2|Disappointing.  The place is too dark, making it difficult to read the menu.  We waited over 20 minutes for bread and the appetizer.  Our waiter was unfocused and seemingly uninterested in providing good service.  The entrees took a long time also and one order was wrong so we waited an additional 15 minutes for them to get it right.  They actually tried to serve us the wrong order twice.  Totally clueless.  I guess the management doesn't care about good service and just hires anyone without training them?  We won't be returning.  Next time we'll go to the food court and pay 1/3 of the price for better food and service."
"250|1|Dined at the Cheesecake in Queens tonight and was overall impressed with our evening.  Even tho it was Thanksgiving Eve and the place was packed, we were greeted with friendly faces and an accurate wait time. Our server Christy was very helpful guiding us with the overwhelming large menu. I had mentioned I was trying to eat Gluten Free as much as possible in the beginning of our dining experience (not intolerant just trying a new diet). The grilled salmon recommended by her was to die for. At the end I was impressed with her memory and presenting both the Gluten free Godiva and Coffee and Cream cheesecakes as options for me on my new diet so I didnt feel so left out next to my husband's Keylime!! My husband enjoyed the Habachi steak, recommended as her favorite dish on the menu, and he said that may have been the best meal of his life!I will definitly be back to try some more of their rather large selection of gluten free items!"
251|2|This is my second time visiting Cheesecake Factory and it was messy the first time but I said this is a new opening. But this second visit put the nail on the coffin. The waitress and waiters are not pleasant portions was smaller. I was sitting in the booth where the waiter and waitresses do the billing transactions and heard all of their conversations over my mom conversation smh very loud . Then I went to get my slices of cheesecake and the girl who was serving the cheesecake to go was touching the cheesecake and everything else never changed her gloves and at the end she rubbed her hands on her pants like a dirty chef . I will not be returning I will just drive further out to Long Island for better services. Also cheesecake was old I told my mom not to eat it .
"252|2|Horrible experience. Waited 35 min for 2 appetizers, got charged 30 bucks, I don't mind Paying but the taste was horrible. Will never be back"
"253|2|First time there, not impressed at all.  Food was not great, very small portions. Appetizer Guac & Chips if there were 15 chips on the plate that was a lot.  Ordered Chocolate Mousse cheesecake, was very good, Banana Cheesecake which along with banana slices on the side were still frozen.  Food took forever to come out, and wasn't even piping hot when it did arrive. Very disappointed in the food.Asked for a birthday candle since it was my daughters 17th bday and I saw that they sang at a few other tables we got our cheesecakes dropped off and i got handed a candle, and she had no lighter. :(  Lights are so dim i had to use my phone light to see the menu, waitress commented how on the other side they kept dropping glasses and dishes, i think its because it was so dark they couldn't see what they were doing.  Bathroom was even darker than the dining room. Waitress was OK, but she really looked like she couldn't be bothered and we were just annoying to her. I have been wanting to go, now that i have I won't go back and probably just should have went across the street to Olive Garden instead."
254|1|First time eating in here the workers were very helpful and courteous to me and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the fried Mac and cheese wow  and the steak Diane also a winner very delicious I definitely will be back and recommend this place
"255|2|Granted today was a national holiday, so we would experience a wait time anywhere we went. Originally we were quoted a 55-70 minute wait time (at 3:10 pm) so we walked around the mall for a bit and came closer to the door around 55 minutes later. We checked with the hostess to make sure we hadn't been called and she said the wait would be about 20 minutes later than they said. She was really nice and we were willing to wait. Finally we had a seat around 4:30. Once we experienced the service, we realized why their wait times to even get a table are so long! While nice, our server was just absent most of the time (and we really don't like overly attentive servers, just reasonably prompt service!). It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks and we ordered food once the drinks came at 4:45. In the meantime, another couple was seated next to us and had a very attentive server who immediately greeted them with bread and water. They ordered food about 10 minutes after us. Their entrees arrived about 20-25 minutes later and our food hadn't arrived yet. For reference, we ordered the lunch BBQ chicken salad and lunch Louisiana pasta while they each had more complex meals that should take longer to prepare. They were finished with their meal when our server finally came over to tell us it would be about 5 more minutes, they were just waiting on the pasta. Finally we got our food at 5:35, 50 minutes after we ordered it.The food itself was good, completely consistent with every Cheesecake Factory I've visited before. Our waitress was nice and got every part of the order right, but the wait times for everything was abysmal. I didn't even consider waiting for cheesecake to go because we didn't have another hour to kill. Maybe we'll come back in a couple months when they've ironed out some kinks in the system."
"256|1|I don't really do Reviews that much, but there'sa first for everything.My friend and I decided to go to the cheesecake factory for lunch. We were greeted by our server Ericka who was just the nicest person ever. she was really busy, and I think she had a lot of tables that day since it was Columbus Day. As we started to order I was disappointed that they didn't have the bacon2x burger that morning it was weird. our server then informed us that since they had just opened the doors and sometimes things aren't ready yet. She then told us that everything in the cheesecake factory was made fresh daily, nothing was microwaved. I guess to forget that they didn't havethe bacon2x burger. Still, it was a cool fact to know when dining in arestaurant. so, since we just wanted burgers we decided to just have a drink first and look at the menu for a while. We have never been to the cheesecake factory before, so we had a lot of questions since the menu is really big. our server, Ericka was more than happy to answer those questions. She knows that menu alright!When we found out my friend was coming we needed a bigger table and Erika was able to move us to a bigger table even though it was busy. then we finally ordered I had a Carbonara, my friend had the Pasta Napolitano, and my other friend had the four-cheese pasta. Again, I was disappointed but not at my server but the restaurant. When my carbonara came out they just told me they didn't have the Napolitano. Now I'm eating, and my friend is just looking at me. One of the managers then came to apologize to us. It's annoying when you are going out to eat and they don't have the things you want to make things worse they tell you 30 min. later. I didn't pay no mind to it since our server came to our table and apologized as well and even made a joke about ""howoh she ate it she was hungry"". Overall, we had a great time in the cheesecake factory because of our server. She made it fun to dine at the cheesecake factory even though it was 2 strikes of them being out of things. I will definitely come back to the cheesecake factory and ask for Ericka."
"257|1|I was really excited to try out this Cheesecake Factory as I've always loved their food. Finally got to do so a few days ago and was very pleased, as expected. Service was friendly and food was excellent. Will definitely return here next time I'm in the area! Looking forward to try out more of their many menu options:)"
258|2|The service was just plain horrible. We had to ask for bread 3 times. We also had to ask for cutlery which took forever so we had to spread the butter with our hands. When the cutlery finally came it was covered in food and crusty. We had to ask THREE people for cutlery to the point where our food had come out and we had to wait to eat it. The fish was cold and we had to wait for the fries. The fries didn't even come until after we were done eating. Horrible service.
"259|2|Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to! First no bread, second no utensils, third learn what medium rare is and chicken pasta was so salty!"
"260|2|DO NOT EAT HERE. My family and I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years, and this was the worst experience we have ever had. Normally, Cheesecake Factory waiters are very attentive and check on us frequently. However, our waitress did not check on us at all. In fact, I had to physically leave my seat to hunt her down. She delivered our appetizers which were cooked poorly, (Ordered the tex mex egg rolls and they are normally cooked to perfection, but this time the chicken on the inside was spilling all into the container) and didn't come back for 35 minutes. Then, we ordered our food which took a while to come and it was cold. I waited for her to come back to ask if she could please heat my food up, but she disappeared. This is when I had to physically leave my seat to look for her. Because she had disappeared into thin air for at least 20 minutes, I found a manager and asked him to heat my food up. He took it right away and I returned to my seat thinking the night would get better. I was wrong. The manager didn't return with my food and it had been at least another 20 minutes. Again, I had to physically leave my seat to find my waitress, and I asked her about my food and she was completely oblivious to the fact that there were any problems with my food. I found her reaction quite interesting as she did not check on us like Cheesecake Factory employees normally do. She told me she would go to the kitchen to check on it, and as I returned to my seat another waitress was updating my party that my food was on its way shortly. I began to relax knowing that my food would be there soon. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and I normally get extra sauce so when my meal was delivered the first time the spaghetti and sauce were both cold. Unfortunately, the second time it came around the sauce was still ice cold, but they managed to heat up the spaghetti (spaghetti also tasted very different from other CF locations, wasn't as good). Because we had spent almost 2 hours there, we were ready to go and paid for our food. My cousin who covered the bill receives alerts every time her card is used and before we could even write our tip in, her bank notified her that she had paid more than what our receipt was showing us. In fact, the total that showed up in her statement included exactly a 20% tip doin to the coin. We were shocked because we hadn't even tipped yet so it made no sense that the tip could automatically be included. We were furious as our experience did not nearly reflect this amount of tip that was given. When we contacted the waitress she had a very nonchalant attitude and was like ""well I didn't add anything I swiped what was there."" We called the manager over hoping to get an explanation, and to our surprise he was just as nonchalant responding with ""well I don't know how that happened."" Neither of them seemed to want to fix the issue or to care to fix the issue. This was a very disturbing experience for me as this is my favorite restaurant. Please do not eat at this location!"
"261|3|I've been trying to come here since it opened but they always have a ridiculous wait time. We finally made the trip on a Saturday around 1 and waited about 35 minutes which wasn't to bad because we got to walk a round the mall a little. They sat us in a area that was a bit closed off and towards the street and my husband and I loved the secluded feeling. Our server was friendly and the food portion was huge!!. My husband and I both couldn't finish half of our salads, and he even ordered a appetizer and took half of that home too. The best part about the Cheesecake Factory is the cheesecake and they have LOW CARB cheesecake! I was so excited and you couldn't tell the difference. All in all the food was good with big portions and I love the low carb options, but there is always a outrageous wait time so be prepared to wait. Call ahead to find out how long the wait is beforehand."
262|2|This is the worst experience I had with the Cheesecake Factory . I usually go to the one in westbury Long Island . The wait was two hours long . So I proceeded to go shopping and came back with in the waiting time to then being told  there additional 20 min extra wait .  Waited some more and was finally seated . We order our food  the waiter then disappeared  for 20 mins we had to ask for utensils. I then called for the manager after waiting for a hour for the food to come out to only be told the order would take longer because I order a steak middalion and salmon combo . The steak is usually a hockey puck sized I told her I usually go to the Long Island Cheesecake Factory and have never waited for a hour and 20 mins  for my food even on the busiest holiday exp Mother's Day  and Valentine's Day . When my order finally came my salmon was extra small  portion  and my steak was luke warm by that time after all that wait I lost my appetite . Their portions of food is nothin in comparison to Long Island.  the service is horrible I went to other steak houses and got bigger steaks rib eyes t bone and porterhouse steaks and the wait was never that long I explained to the manger but it fell on death ears because you can tell all she wanted to do was go home . Would not recommend this Cheesecake Factory just take the extra time and drive to westbury. Forgot to add  that they said it was free parking they would stamp my ticket the waiter took my ticket and never stamped it !! Went to  leave parking lot had to pay  smh so it took a total of 3 and half hours to get bad service. Bad food  not worth it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"263|1|Came here on a Saturday evening around 4:45 and was told it would be an hour wait for a party of four. And boy did they mean an hour we were called around 5:34 or so. The wait was a little frustrating not because of the time but because their pager only works as far as JC Penney on one side of the mall and only on that floor. I recommend they get a text system so you can enjoy the mall and come back when your table is ready. Nevertheless we were seated, I have to say that the restaurant is dark you really have to struggle to see the menu. We were served sourdough bread that was a little hard and didn't taste good. They also never bought us plates so we ended up with crumbs everywhere as did the table next to us. The pumpernickel bread was much better and served warm. We didn't order  drinks just a couple of waters with lemon, for our entree I had the white chilli chicken it's on the skinnylicious menu it was nice and flavorful. My cousin had the mashed potatoes with the pork chop he said the pork chop was flavorful and the mashed potatoes were excellent. My mom had the Louisiana pasta which I had a taste of. The chicken was well breaded and fried. Lastly my cousin said her steak was wonderful and lean. We also ordered the cheesecakes personally I prefer Juniors downtown brooklyn but their variety is welcomed. Overall they did a good job and our server Lamar was nice and attentive."
"264|2|Truly disappointed come here weekly to order my favorite appetizer buffalo wings for the past three times wings are charred and super dry.  I should have taken a pic. I ask to speak with the manager who did not appear to care much stated they are using a different batter and working on a new recipe. REALLY it kind of looks like they need a new cook instead.  The week before that I order a filet mignon another fail, please take your money elsewhere with all the competition surrounding them looks like they are not too worried about fixing that recipe literally three weeks later.  After many tries I am literally done with this place."
"265|2|So I've been to the Cheese Cake Factory before, With much delight! This Factory was close to home so after a few hours of shopping I thought I would give it a shot! Ok so basically my daughters and I waited for about a hour! Not bad ok we waited!! After we where seated a nice waitress came over took our drink orders, brought them to our table quickly then disappeared! After almost 30 minutes more another server came over and ask if the 1st server took out order so she explained it was coming out! Not explaining to us that she was the new waitress cause the 1st one went on a break! After another 30 minutes I casually walk over to the manager and ask what was the deal! Cause we waited for a full hour for freaking appetizers he walked to the kitchen and came out with one order from the four, then 15 minutes later we were all eating and they also brought out My to go order! to think it was such a disappointment, cause at that point we were to tired to eat! When the bill came it was a whomping $97.00 I then ask the waitress to tell the manager he need to adjust the bill..just for us waiting so long he did! The bill was adjusted to $40.00 our drinks and to go order was free...plus I still gave the waitress a $10.00 tip! Even if she didn't explain! She was the new waitress! Oh yea! And while we wait the fire alarm was blasting for almost 15 minutes with not even an explanation to as why? This establishment is good for those who live in the neighborhood and have no car to travel else where!"
266|2|Do not go to this spot please go to the other spot in Nassau County. I went here with my family and the waitress only attended to us once or twice someone else brought our food and she expected to get a very good tip. She was complaining about her tip. First of all we had to wait more than hour secondly the waiter was very rude. I highly recommend the other location
"267|3|The food was good however being that I came in the early afternoon (prior to 5pm) and was told that you ran out of calamari and ICE CREAM, this visit didnt get 5 stars. This is my first time here and it isnt acceptable that you run out of something as simple as ice cream prior to the evening crowd when you open at 11:30am. Will i visit again or recommend this location? im not sure because when people go to a restaurant and look at a menu, they have an idea of the food they would like to have."
"268|1|I never truly realized how rude and obnoxious New Yorkers are. They find any reason to complain about restaurants when it's not even the workers fault. So I came here yesterday on a Saturday night and we all knew the wait would be long. It's fine though, we went shopping, the mall is literally right there duh. I don't get why people complain about the wait when they have a mall, literally footsteps away! Talk about common sense. And then these people hound all around the entrance and block the way for others. Anyway, everything was good and our waitress Elsa was very attentive and told us exactly when our food was coming out. The service was really good! Food: I started off with a piña colada which was good and the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders which were really good 5/5. My favorite appetizer from here! As for entree, I got my favorite Chicken & Biscuits which was good, however I wish they poured more sauce over the gravy and it was slightly warm when it reached the table. Regardless still good. And for dessert, I ended up taking a Strawberry Cheesecake to go, which was delicious! That concludes it all folks! Don't believe in half of these ridiculous reviews. The food and service was great. A huge thank you to Elsa as well!"
"269|1|Lovely staff. I was greeted and seated rather quickly. Since I've been to the Cheesecake Factory before but not this particular restaurant I ordered my go to, which is the fried Mac N Cheese and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. Everything was great! I would go back."
"270|2|I usually LOVE the Cheesecake Factory but this location is horrible!! Very unsanitary and very rude service. Employees are very unprofessional and needs better service. Family warned  me about this location, but I doubted them because I have always had nothing but great experiences at the Cheesecake Factory. Very dissatisfied and disappointed in my most recent experience."
271|2|Wait time was almost an hour for the food to come. Crab Hash from the brunch section was a bit burnt. Waiter forgot our bagel. I feel like the environment of the place with all its decorations is better than the food and service combined haha~
272|3|Saddened by there great or horrible service. They are either outstanding or horrid there's no in between. Very upsetting you have to try and catch this place on it's best days or not at all. Good luck!
"273|2|Long wait time, with an even longer serve time. The food is decent with a jumpy waiter.  Ordered with 5 people and couldn't seat us in about 20 minutes. And this isn't even in peak hours. Although everything else was mediocre, the cheesecake was something to look forward throughout the dinner."
"274|2|When we first got there, our waiter gave us a moment however he seemed to have disappeared for 20 min, after we ordered our food but we didn't have any utensils and again our waiter was gone for a long time, I ordered a pasta and spilled sauce on my white shirt, after I did laundry the stain is still visible sadly, also we wanted to order desserts but again the waiter spent about 30 min to follow his dreams or something, wasn't my best experience but maybe I'll try it again"
275|2|Worst experience ever!!! We did not have to wait to be seated but once we sat down we were greeted from one of Joe's roommates...a nice healthy roach!!! We asked to move our seat and the new table had a dirty fork on the floor underneath.We had to wait over 20 min to place our order and then another 20 or so min to get our food. The manager never came back to see if we were ok after our extra unwanted guest at our 1st table. Definitely will not be going back to this location EVER.
"276|1|I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, and didn't expect much, but our party of 6 came here during a packed Saturday night for an informal birthday celebration. From the moment we sat down, our server Jewel made us feel like we were at a mom-and-pop neighborhood restaurant in the best possible way, everyone in our party remarked that she provided some of the best service we've ever had in NYC. We had planned on just having cocktails and apps, but because of Jewel we settled in and didn't leave for hours. The food was way better than expected as well, but it was Jewel that made us stay. I hope Cheesecake Factory knows what a stellar employee they have, we'll be returning soon solely because of Jewel's amazing service."
277|2|Stay away from this location. Great food but the customer service is the WORST!Never going back to the Elmhurst location again!
"278|1|We love this restaurant. Its been a few years since we've been to a cheesecake factory restaurant.  We will definitely come back . We had 2 appetizers, the eggroll sampler and the hot spinach & cheese dip. These were both over the top delicious.  I had the Thai coconut-lime chicken. This was so good I was licking the plate clean, no shame. lol. My daughter had the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. That was delicious as well. The wait time was literally 5 minutes then we were seated. The waiter was so friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu. We grilled him extensively because it had been so long since we had been to this restaurant. But he was very gracious and accommodating. I cant wait until our next trip to this wonderful and beautiful restaurant"
279|2|On a Wednesday you have to wait over an hour for food. The place is understaffed. Definitely would not recommend to friends. The one on Old country rd better than this place.
"280|3|Great service from waiter, but noddles to my shrimp scampi weren't fully cooked :( besides that everything else was great."
"281|2|We called in advance to let them know that a party of 10 will be coming in 10mins. The hostess said she will note it and since they don't take reservations maximum wait if anything will be 5-10mins. Went there and it was packed, was told the wait is 20mins. but after 20 mins has passed and we were still not seated we just left. Do not go there if you have to go somewhere else after. It's packed and so disorganized"
"282|2|We try to avoid long wait and arrived at door open, still take them 15 minutes to seat us. The waitress is really slow, took her 20 minutes to come to our table and take simple 3 orders. Took another 20 minutes for her to bring us bread. Finally one hour later, we have to request to rush out our order,  the food is not as good as other cheese cake factory, and it took us total 2 hours to grab a lunch. Totally disappointed and will never return again."
283|2|Poor customer service we had a birthday celebration of 12pp waited since 7:30pm it's 9:30pm still not seated.
284|1|I had an amazing experience at the Cheesecake Factory besides the long wait which made sense being a weekend everything went perfect. My boyfriend suggested I get shrimp since he knows I love seafood and because it was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory. I got the shrimp pasta which came as a huge portion I was able to have it for dinner lunch and dinner again the next day lol My boyfriend got the bbq chicken salad which was huge but he enjoyed it as well and finished it that night. But let me tell you about those avocado rolls and the tamarind sauce ! As soon as I tasted the sauce I thought I was back in Trinidad eating a Doubles infused with Asian (eggroll) and avocado. We were so impressed we had to thank the waitress for suggesting it. The waitress was so on point as well I wish I remembered her name she gave us the best service I have ever had and she was very knowledgeable and patient. We will definitely be coming back !
"285|2|We were very excited to try this place but experience was totally NEGATIVE!! Not only that Waiting time was sooo long, the service desk staff was nasty!! Despite all that we ended up taking take out only to find out that food was just average, in fact below average taste! Only good thing was staff at take out desk, at least they were helpful vs the service desk where they were not just nasty but visibly discriminating!!!!"
286|2|Well where do we start !!! My daughter and I walked in for a late snack at the bar ( such by the way is first came first served ) sat at a table and waited for 15 min to be told by the server that he has been closed for 30 min ?? Ok well he moved us to a different table .. Sat there with menus and been ignored by the server ... 15 min later another waiter came and introduced him self and ask what will we like to order.. In the middle of all this the table that we sat first was sat and served !!!! This branch is a disaster I been to others CCF's around the United States but this one at the queens center mall is just horrible ... The food took long the drinks took ... Second and last time ...
287|2|Service was poor..fiod was mediocre at best and the experience was overall frustrating
"288|1|long wait, but totally worth it.  The food is good (not gourmet, but wasn't expecting it to be), we came for the desserts and were not disappointed.  Nice add to the neighborhood"
289|1|Crowded but good food. Pricy but huge menu. Some time there's a long wait. Other than that friendly service. Clean location. If you love cheese cake it's a must place to visit. But for me I also like there full menu and other desserts as well. If the prices were a little bit more reasonable I would have visited there more often.
"290|1|Me and the Girlfriend had dinner twice and both times were amazing. Great food and staff were very nice, and I can't wait to go back"
291|3|Medicore food. Very close to where i live so yes i will come back maybe once a year. The cheesecake are ok as well. Servicd is great though.
"292|1|Went here with a friend and the food is absolutely good, the best place to go eat. The service is really good and the workers are all very kind. Definetly worth coming back! :)"
"293|2|This Cheesecake Factory location was the worst dining experience I've ever had. We waited over 15 min to be asked what we wanted to drink. When people who came in after us were already being served. After were seated, and the appetizers that we ordered were cold. After sending it back, they had brought over another one which was no different, it was also cold. We had never even received plates for the appetizers. We had asked for a knife 3 times and it was never brought over. When the entrees came out, they were also cold. It was disgusting. I asked for honey mustard when my entree arrived and received it towards the end of my meal. Never coming back here again. Very disappointed with the service, the waiter was no where to be found half the time. When we received the bill they had actually charged us TWICE for the cold appetizers. If I can give half of a star, I would."
294|1|We had a Saturday brunch with my family. We had a really good time and the egg Benedict's was delicious. The staffs are nice and professional.
"295|1|The Cheesecake Factory has an extensive, mouth watering menu! From appetizers, small plate bar foods, salads, entrees, etc. I thought I could not go wrong. I ordered the grilled pork chop and was impressed when I saw the beautifully plated meal.  Unfortunately, the chef did not know PORK IS NEVER SERVED RARE, AND THIS WAS RAW! I cannot imagine how he or she could allow that to leave the kitchen! And mind you, I had asked for WELL DONE! So now I had to send it back and wait another 20 minutes or so.  I must say it was delicious when it was finally served, well done and still tender and juicy."
"296|2|So this is my second time here....the only thingI remember from the first time is that service took too too long. This time: hostess saw me and just ignored me for at least 10', she was on the phone (which is ok), but at least acknowledge the people who are waiting. When I sat down: it took another 15' for the server to come to me, I ordered a glass of wine and I asked what side salmon comes with. The server didn't know, but I thought he might be new so I gave him the Chance to ask his coworkers. He never came back. I asked another server if I can finally place my order, she said ok but she never came back. My server finally came to my table and he said salmon comes with mash potatoes and green beans, I said ok. My wine came and the glass was dirty. I didn't say anything, I drunk from a different side. Keep in mind that I work in the business and I know how some things work....yet there are some things that I cannot tolerate. My salmon came (with asparagus, Not green beans), the silverware were disgusting, like they were never washed!!! I asked for new ones, they gave it to me. Food was good. The server asked if I needed some water, I said yes, but he never brought it. I asked for the check, paid it and left. I think the whole experience was ridiculous"
297|2|Just drive to one in LI or Yonkers! Ordered the nachos and they were soaked in oil. Soggy too. Pizza was bleh. Soft like it had been microwaved and tasted like out of a box. Our server was cool and of course the Cheesecake was good. Those are what my two stars are for!
298|1|Never had anything i didnt like here. Staff is wonderful and cheery even on busy nights. Upside is that you can go shopping whike you wait since its part of the queens center mall.
"299|2|My overall experience was terrible. There weren't a lot of customers so I was seated fairly quickly. While waiting for the waiter, I noticed that both my fork and spoon were dirty, it wasn't clean and there was food stuck to it. I also asked for ginger ale but they said they ran out. They also said they ran out of bread and they were making more, therefore the bread came out after the main dishes. The main dishes were okay, I had the hibachi steak and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. When I asked for the check, the waiter billed me for the ginger ale that they ran out of and when they fixed it, they also gave me someone else's check with my check. I wouldn't recommend coming here."
"300|2|Not worth the hour and 30 min wait time. Not kid friendly seater gave us attitude for having a baby carriage. Order filet mignon well done, they gave me medium rare. Mash potato was cold yet plate was warm??? Not worth the time, for that go across the street to Longhorn steakhouse."
"301|2|We came back a month later. And we were told the wait was an hour and a half. We left again. I hope that management can run this business more efficiently. It is a huge space. And people are thrilled to have this as a dining option. But nothing is worth that wait. We came on a Monday night for an early dinner. Bad idea. Crowded. Horrible service. We were told we had to wait an hour for a table for our party of 6, so we took a booth instead. It wasn't about the seating...everything took an hour. Appetizers. Main course. I left before dessert came. We ordered ice cream. It took 20 mins for us to find out that they were out of strawberry shortcake. It is a huge restaurant w a huge kitchen. I don't understand why the food would take so long. So- go if you have time to sit around a dark and loud restaurant w great bread and butter."
"302|2|I was very disappointed. It was totally not worth the wait. First, we waited about an hour to get a table. I thought it was acceptable. We ordered food and it took about 30-40 min for it to be ready. And what was funny was, we weren't given any utensils. I had to ask 4-5 severs and only one actually got back to  me with forks. We order steak, and they expect us to eat it with a fork? ON the other hand, I waited 15 min just for the fork. I had to ask for napkins at the end...it was not worth it...never going again. I cannot believe a fancy restaurant like this had such servers...I have nothing to say...worst experience ever"
"303|3|We went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time on Saturday at around 3:45.  There was over a 60 minute wait.  Once we were seated there was another 45 minute for the meal.  The food was good, but not great. The restaurant reminded me of Junior's in Manhattan, which is our place to eat before or after Broadway shows.  The difference is the wait was longer, the service was not as good, and even the Carrot Cheesecake was not as rich and thick as Juniors, although it was very sweet. Our 3 hour experience to have an early dinner ended up being nothing really special. I'd think twice about bringing  your family there and spending over a hundred dollars for average service and maybe a little bit above average food, with an above average wait time."
"304|2|Food was inedible, barley any chicken in my Chipotle  Chicken pasta dish. The kitchen crew should be fired. My friends food was also burnt shown in the picture I posted. The Manager should also be fired this is the 2nd time i came here and the food was cooked inproperly , cold or burnt and very greasy. Ive been to other CCFs and they made this place look worse than a fast food joint. I couldnt even finish my disgusting overpriced meal. The only thing nice was my waitress. . Fire manager, fire the cooks and keep the waitress."
"305|2|first off they nailed it with the design of the restaurant, Great acoustics, large spacse broken up into smaller which is pleasant.having worked and managed restaurants I know how challenging and opening can be. Especially hard for the staff to be fully familiar with such a huge menu. Visited thursday and they were out of ginger ale, really guys; you couldn't just go to the store across the street and pick up a case?Waiter was pleasant but stumbled on answering questions. avocado spring rolls  were good. burger and carbonara pasta just so so. next time will eat at shake shack and come for a cheese cake."
"306|2|Like many, we were excited that a Cheesecake Factory was opening up in Queens. However, was very disappointed when we were finally seated (about an hour later). We received one waitress and I guess her shift was over so we received another waitress. The orders that were taken from the first waitress was correct, however, when finally received our orders two of dishes were not prepared nor delivered. Take in mind the time was also late after 9 and on a Monday. One of my guests were starving because both orders belong to this person (appetizer and entrée). The manager comes over to apologize, but by this time it does nothing as the food is still missing. Finally when the orders do arrive, they aren't prepared properly. Three of the orders did not taste good either and it was cold. By the time we paid the bill, there was nothing on the bill to compensate the frustration that we incurred, but because the fault was not of the waitress, she received her deserved tip. I do not think we will be going back to this location, but I like to give people another chance, but would like to stress that we were highly disappointed in the service and food quality.Would not recommend the Shrimp with Angel hair pasta (very bland), chicken marsala (which is normally good, but it was sweet and something was off) and spicy pasta with chicken (just wasn't good)Almost forgot to add we also ordered cheesecake which is the highlight of the place, but the cheesecake was semi frozen! After writing this review, I am second guessing on ever returning to this location."
"307|2|I love the Cheesecake Factory as I have frequented a few locations in the south. I was very excited when I heard about the location opening at Queenscenter Mall. Two of my girlfriends and my self decided to meet up for dinner, I was told the wait is 30 minutes which ended up being 1 hour. When we were finally seated we ordered drinks and appetizers and that portion was pretty fast. The waitress assured us our entree would be out in approximately 20 mins, we did not get our entrees until an hour and twenty minutes later. She came out once and explained that there was a mix up with their computer and our orders. We then asked to speak to a manager because it took another 20 minutes after her explanation and our food still didn't arrive at our table. We had to make a complaint before it happened.  At that point we just wanted to leave but we ordered desert to go and made it clear to them that we had to leave since we spent all of our time waiting. Our cheesecake didn't come out until 20 minutes after they made our to-go bags. That was absolutely the worst experience I ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I am not going back until they have been opened for another 6 months. They need to train their staff properly and also educate them on the menu and it's contents. Our server didn't know there was sausages in the gumbo. And she didn't know how to grate the cheese. Half of it landed on my phone and the table. I am not one to complain even if my service was bad but I do believe that experience should not have equated to us paying."
"308|1|My first time to a Cheesecake Factory! For a Saturday night, it's a brutal wait. We were told about 10 minutes, but it was much, much longer. I want to say nearly an hour - but you can't expect much when you're relying on customers to finish and leave. It's nearly 8pm and they're having a good time. It's a good sign when the guests don't want to leave! But they should provide a more realistic wait time. It was very helpful with the hostess updated me with how many tables were ahead of me when I asked. That gave me a good idea of what I was in for.We were seated in the outer section, street view. It's closed off from the main dining area, much quieter, kind of loved it. I forgot our server's name, but she was the most pleasant. Whoever you are with your Star Wars tie: you're wonderful and don't change. The food is certainly better than what I expect from a chain. Their loaded potato tots are like miniature baked potatoes in your mouth. The burger buns were perfectly toasted and so fluffy. I think that was the most impressive of the burger. Love a good bun.Now for the cheesecake. We ordered to go because the way I feel about cheesecake should not be displayed in public places. With that said, their Oreo Extreme cheesecake is so delicious. Adam's Reese's is also great, but it's much heavier, probably because of the caramel. If you want to try their cheesecakes, go all out. No need to play it safe with the classic. These signatures are signatures for a reason. Bring your patience, plan ahead. If you look them up on Google Maps, it'll show you the busy level by the hour. For a weekend night, though? Be prepared to wait OR go earlier."
"309|1|Food was good, atmosphere was great, wait time was a little long but worth it. The server TJ was awesome I absolutely love love love him. Will come back again and again if for nothing else for TJ..."
310|2|Server didn't know I was his table. Offered bread. Came back and offered bread again. Asked for wine and water. Took 15 mins for both. No straw given or offered. Gave me wrong glassware for water. Didn't offer my guest who came before they delivered the wine anything. I ordered a drink for her. Took 10 mins for is to both get straws. Ordered all food. Appetizer was made incorrect but we weren't told. Ate a whole app before second came. Entrees came too. Manager came to fix but didn't do enough listening and lacked empathy and urgency.  ordered round 2 of drinks with manager but that took 15 mins.  Food was good. That's the second star here. In the end the experience was very subpar. Despite the manager being aware of the issues the ending was mundane and all he offered was a single free app. It wasn't about the money; it's how they made us feel. Our experience was not valued and the cheesecake brand was not shown to be as good as advertised.
"311|1|I had heard a lot about Cheesecake Factory. When I finally went in, the staff was very nice and polite. The decorations are also beautiful for family time or a date. I loved my favorite appetizer spinach dip but I wasn't the fan of the pasta I had ordered for meal. Perhaps next time I go in, I will try the steak. I have heard good things about it. Give it a try, deserts are great as well!"
"312|2|Our family was excited to come because we liked the Cheesecake Factory in Long Island.  We waited about an hour to be seated, which was ok.  However, by that time, the 1 year old fell asleep.  We asked if we could keep him in the stroller until he woke up.  Guy said ""No"", we cannot have our stroller in the dining area...""let him sleep in the high chair.""  ""No thanks,"" I said, ""I'll have him sleep on the bench.""  I ordered 4-cheese pasta, sister got lemon-herb roasted chicken and substituted mashed potatoes for cilantro rice, my partner got pasta with shrimp and sausage.  30 minutes later, food arrived.  My 4-cheese pasta was ok.  There was a white blob on top, which I assumed was ricotta, since that's what it said on the menu, but it tasted more like herbed cream cheese?? Pregnant sister's rice was hard and raw.  She asked server to ask the kitchen about it, and server said that batch of rice would be fully cooked in about 5 minutes, so she happily brought my sister back cooked rice after 5 minutes.  Now for partner's pasta... I really wish I took a photo.  His food was more expensive than mine, yet it was 1/3 of the size.  There were 3 pieces of shrimp on it.  What the fuck?  AND it was cold.  We had already waited too long, and our son was starting to fuss, so partner didn't bother complaining.  He left the restaurant hungry and angry.  The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is that our server was very pleasant despite the fact that she works in a crap hole."
313|1|Can't here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. It was pretty empty. Ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage which was pretty good. Food took a while even though there weren't that many people. Pretty inexpensive for lunch specials.
"314|1|so far it's been twice I've gone to the cheesecake factory and i ate everything on my plate each time... this year was the first time iver ever ate here too, for years ive wanted to try it out but there wasn't ever a close location unroll this one!!! Perfect for after shopping hunger stress lmao.. they also served me Big plates which left me full and satisfied. Though  i dont remember the names of the plates I've had so far I can say i have a habit of (because im so picky) always asking a waiter, ""whats the best in the menu"" and both times at the cheesecake factory I got something different that they preferred (staff was very honest as well)  and I fell in love with it just as they said I would.  Oh and the bread was super yummy... soft and warm....ugh I can't wait to go again.. next  time I will take pictures of my meal and write a better helpful review for anyone else out there that wants to know what to eat and how good it really it.."
"315|2|I've been to the location a few times . But today on 5/23/15 I walked out after finding myself arguing with the most incompetent server I have ever met . My friend and I walked in 40 minutes before closing time so we ordered pretty quickly. Appetizer was served along with my drink (skinny mojito) . Now This mojito had to be the sweetest mojito I've ever had in my life . I'm talking unbearably sweet. So i stopped our server and expressed to him that it was too sweet and jokingly added that it was like there is no alcohol in it . To which he replies well if I change it it's not like they are going to put more alcohol . I can get you a shot and you can pour it in yourself . Well after hearing that response my friend was irked Because  never have we heard such a ridiculous thing . My friend lifts up my drink looked him in the eye and said ""bring her a new drink "" That is what any experienced waiter working in decent place would know to do . Never in my life has someone suggested a shot of alcohol . They always take the drink and bring it back tasting like it won't give me diabetes. So what does the waiter do ? Brings me back the drink with the shot of alcohol ! I look at him and tell him that I am not a bartender and that usually i don't sit there and pour a shot to fix my drink . This guy tone of voice goes ten octaves higher while waving his hands as he speaks saying that ""clearly I dont understand that they won't add more alcohol to my drink unless I'm charged for it "" He clearly didn't understand how badly I wanted to throw the drink in his face for the way he was talking to me . At this point we are going back and forth Arguing to which he says I'm walking away . So In return i put on my coat and also walked away and left . And I promise I won't ever be back to this Cheesecake Factory . Unless they hire servers that know what it's like to make every dining experience a pleasant one. I've never been so annoyed and dissatisfied with a server the way I was with this man . Over a drink ? How can the Cheesecake Factory employ people with such poor communication skills and overall rude behavior ? I know I could've alerted management but frankly walking away was all the energy I had left in me for that day . I'm glad I didn't stay. I don't know someone that would stay and wait to pay to get served by that insolent inexperienced and incompetent person ."
"316|2|I rarely ever get to TCF bc of course up until now we don't have one near by but what I love is of course the cheesecake and their bread!! Lol our server who was the most UNATTENTIVE I've ever experienced informed us they were out of bread....what???? What restaurant anywhere in the world runs out of bread? Anyway... food took about 20 mins to come out, he didn't bring our drinks till about 10 mins after we got our food and my order was wrong. Food overall was ok and the cheesecake of course was great but when I asked for a recommendation as I usually get the same banana cream all the time, he had no clue how to answer or offer ANY opinion- YOU'RE A SERVER AT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY...SERIOUSLY?? Then we had to track him down for our check-20 mins go by. I asked for the bill to be split a certain way, did calculation and even made it easy writing the specific amounts and the last name for that card and he comes back with the bill split in half. So pretty much someone who only had cheesecake had to pay 25 bucks out of pocket bc our server was incompetent. I will be sticking to once a year when I get to travel and come across one, this place was not to standard on overall operations at all."
"317|1|Arrived and the wait was 15 mins.  Love the decor of the restaurant.  No issues with the waiter and the food is excellent and you do get a lot.  Came to celebrate my daughters birthday and today is National cheesecake day, so slices of cheesecake 1/2 priced.  They validate your parking for 2 hours if your bill is over 30 per person  - nice incentive."
"318|2|I went to the Cheesecake Factory with a group of my friends yesterday and we had Wendy F as a server. From the second she took our drink order, my friend made a comment, I don't like her. I didn't notice anything from the first interaction with her, but after waiting 15 mins for just our water and drinks, we notice not only did it take us 1 hour to get seated, it took forever to get WATER. Then we were expecting us to be given bread... but 30 mins later, nothing. We had to complain to ask how long out food is going to take and Wendy finally goes, ""since you're so hungry, do you want some bread to hold you over?""  Wow... talk about horrible customer service. Many more things went wrong that night but I don't even want to type it out because it angers me so much. The management is horrible here. Train your staff better or you guys might as well shut down. I rather drive to Long Island for the Cheesecake Factory then to eat mediocre food in queens."
"319|2|The worst experienced ever! Don't waste your time and money here! Terrible service, cold food, and on top of that, they charged my credit card 3 times with 3 different amounts from other tables ""by mistake"" ....let's start saying we had to wait over 1 hr to get a table, then they served us the food 30 minutes later and it was cooked the wrong way as what we inniatly ordered..... Then they brought us the drinks (wine, sangria) AFTER we finishied eating. 10 min later the rude and NOT professional manager Amamda brought us the Pina Colada that we had ordered over an hour ago, and that of course we refused to accept!. We finally ask for the bill and when the waiter comes back he charged a different (higher) amount to my credit card. I told him and decided to go with him to the cash register kiosk to make sure I have a refund receipt and when I he charges again my card, he charges it with another higher different amount! This was unbelievable!! I ask to talk to the manager and to my surprise is Amanda, the lady who was rude and unprofessional when they decided to bring us the Pina colada like 10 minutes later after we finished eating!! Simply ridiculous!!! I'll never go back there!!  And Noone should!!"
"320|2|I've been to the one located by queens center mall before and I've had great experiences in the past, but the last time I stopped by was just annoying. There was a change with the server half way through our visit. Our waitress' shift was over and we were given this other waiter. He wasn't very nice, but that's beside the point. I've always paid credit, but decided to pay cash this time. I gave a $10 tip even though the total came up to way more than I expected, but I still think he deserved a tip.  When my parents and I got up to leave, the waiter told us to hold on. He counted the money and said the tip should be $22 more than what we gave him...$22 is more than a meal there. It was just ridiculous. He didn't deserve a $32 tip, but he made it seem like it was mandatory. The 15% suggested tip on the receipt is a suggestion!I don't think I'm going back there anymore. We're actually very upset about everything. He made the whole afternoon awkward and uncomfortable after we'd just had a nice meal."
"321|3|The food is really good, just like any other cheesecake factory, but the wait is ridiculous! Avoid weekend dinners. Me and my husband went there around 5:30 and waited an hour and a half just to get a buzzer and had to wait another hour and a half to get seated. Best time to go is during lunch time or early evenings on weekdays. The food and service is pretty good if you have the time and patience to wait over 2 hours for seating."
"322|2|Service is horrible here, waited an hour for food to come out, then comes out so cold that its been sittinh there. Servers are not attentive at all. I rather drive an hour to the long island location then to come to this one again."
"323|2|Normally love the Cheesecake Factory especially because of the kids.. we always go to the garden city location and have enjoyed every time. This location is awful. We entered with a party of 7,,, they needed a managers approval for such a large party. We waited patiently. Finally we were seated .. ordered drinks, and were told they were not serving soda because they were having issues with the c02 .. fine , what else to drink? Only water and ginger ale. Next we ordered appetizers. All came  out before any water was served. He forgot the kids appetizers and my son who had a gluten allergy specified no croutons on his salad ... of course the salad came out with croutons. My husband went up the bar to get our drinks (water) ... three items we wanted to order they were ""out of"" .. meals came out somewhat quick but the pork sandwich which we specified only pork came  out with all condiments. The waiter was apologetic. Knew the service was lousy. The manager Kate was Sent over... we explained our distaste for the service she just smiled and said ""if I can help u in any way let me know"" zero help. Honestly seemed like she was on another planet. Bottom line... horrible service... horrible management... and we won't be back,, good luck."
"324|1|Went on a Thursday night for dinner, seated right away and service was excellent! My bf ordered steak. We've eaten at Longhorn, Peter Lugers, Ruth Chris and this steak was cooked amazing! On busier days service is not as great-small location. Great for off-peak meals!"
"325|2|Not accommodating for families with a stroller. Told the waitstaff that we are a family of 3 adults, 1 child and 1 stroller (infant was sleeping in the stroller). We were led to a table, and after seating were asked to leave so that they can sit a 2 person table. We waited 22 minutes for water. We ordered 3 sandwiches and one pizza - took 50 minutes to come out of the kitchen. The waitress was very unhelpful. We were done eating and waiting for dessert is when the waitress asked us to move the stroller even though the baby was still sleeping. Would never go back. It is right across the mall but I would recommend going somewhere else. Staff are not courteous and the food is far from satisfactory."
326|2|Horrible experience.. very long wait for seats very long wait for waitress very long wait for drinks/ food .. food and price definitely overrated..
"327|2|I like the cheesecake, and the food isn't bad for a chain, however, the service at this location is consistently bad. At first I thought it was opening pains but now believe it is the norm. I have been to other locations and have never had issues so not sure what the problem is here. Diners beware......"
"328|1|Just had dinner with my family here and I must say the food was great. The wait was no more than 20 minutes and the customer service was even greater. We were greeted by our server Noelia (I hope I spelled her name right) who had a beautiful smile and was lovely the entire time. She stepped away for a short break, introduced us to our new server who was also great. Our food came in about 20 minutes and even though we didn't get everything all at once, the manager came over to our table, apologized and reassured us that the rest of our food was coming shortly. Once the rest of our food arrived she came over to check on us. She made a really great comment about how time was passing by so fast and it's most likely because she enjoys her job which is hard to believe on a Friday night at a busy restaurant but she was amazing. Keep up the great work Noelia and the positive energy, it was contagious!!"
"329|2|No more stars for them. Don't understand the hype with them. Food was mediocre & I was not impressed at all. Had a 40min wait for a Sunday evening which was expected but went quickly since you don't have to stand there & wait, you can walk out to a certain number of feet. Waitress was slow & came to us a couple of times but took long to bring us drinks. Got a passion fruit mojito with wayy to much mint & didn't say like any pasionfrjkt at all. Appetizers were extremely fast which means they sit there under a lamp because it's the most ordered. Apps wernt that bad but I wouldnt order it again(avocado rolls)& loaded tots were like something you buy in the freezer aisle. I'd rate the food a 5, paste was wayyy too al dente for me & they sprinkle way to much of the parsley on top that you can't even taste your food. You're too busy pushing the stuff to the side or trying to rub it off your food. Stop garnishing our food with stuff, not everyone wants tablespoons of garnish with their meal. After she gave us the check & came back to get it. Left her a cash tip (I'm never cheap with tips because you never know if they are trying to be fast & are just short handed that day) but she didn't even say thank you. We just left. Wouldn't be back, not cuz of the service but the food."
330|1|Today I walked inside the cheesecake around 4;40 and Steve one of the hostess had told me my wait time was 30 mins. Which isn't so bad since every is always saying they wait so long. I had asked Steve if I can actually pick my waitress because boy let me tell you my waitress Sharlynn I think that's how you spell it is an amazing waitress. She's fast quick and very funny. She knows how to speak to her costumers and always came back to the table checking up on us. I had the chicken park with French fries boy was that Yummyy 13.95 for that too was worth it. Also I ordered some nachos they weren't all that but they were still pretty good if they had filled up the nachos it would've been a perfect night. But besides al that I had an amazing time today at the cheesecake and I will be coming back every thursdays just for Sharlynn so please make sure Sharlynn is there ever thursdays:)) best waitress ever
"331|2|I will be posting this on everything possible so the owners of this franchise know how horrible their employees are. Lets off with, we were told our table will take 40 minutes to be ready. After 1 hour we went to check on our table and the hostess forgot about us. How nice! Then our server was horrible. I dont think I need to go into details about how horrible she was. Food took forever to get to us. The employees were loud! Everybody walking around talking to each other instead of doing their jobs. People applying lipstick in front of customers instead of going into the bathroom. Our server was really forgetful. To top it all off! I got pasta which included mushrooms. When I placed my order I said NO MUSHROOMS! Yet still when my food came it had mushrooms. I told her and she blamed the kitchen. I was told they will remake it all from strach because its not a hard dish. I ate some that night and I didnt get any mushrooms. Fast foward to the next day. Im eating my food and what do I see? Mushrooms! I am allergic. If I have intense reaction to the food I will sue! Ps. We were there May 17th 2017. Check your employees"
332|1|Would give 5 stars but the drinks suck. Foods always awsome tho! For two people figure youll spend a cool hundred bucks. One drink each. Customer service is good too
333|1|Amazing food. The Lunch specials are great and very affordable. The portions are very good too. Our server was Isis. She was great from start to finish. Amazing people skills and very good server. Ask for her if you go!
334|2|Today was the 1st time we went to this location we got seated right away wasn't to busy for lunch but we sat there for almost 15 minutes before deciding to leave because no waitor came at all.
335|2|Food was good but I ordered the fish n chips. It was good but the menu picture shows 5-6 pieces of fish and when the dinner was brought out to me it was only 3 little pieces of fish. So disappointed for the cost to get so little.
336|2|If i could give this place 0 stars i would. We went to this place for my fiances sisters birthday. We where one of the first people to arrive at the cheesecake factory and still waited 1 hour. It was 4 of us we all ordered differents foods. My fiance ordered the filet mignon and her sister ordered the gumbo with brown rice. I ordered a kobe burger with fries and my fiances brother ordered the burger as well. After waiting for 40 mins the waitress brings over my fiances filet mignon and her sisters gumbo (The food was cold). She then tells us that our burgers should be out soon that after 40 minutes our sweet potato fries where not ready. (40 minutes for french fries?). The waitress then comes out with one burger saying my kobe burger still isnt ready. I didn't know it took over 40 mins for a burger and fries. After waiting another 10 mins i finally just asked for the manager (which also took her bout 15 mins to even come to my table) I cancelled the burger and sat with no food. Overall horrible experience i do not recommend eating here. The food wasn't even good so save your money and go somewhere better where they know what there doing in the front of house and back of house.
337|2|This place is disgusting. We always go to the Long Island location and never have an issue. Waited two hours to eat they messed up my food twice. My son got two chicken balls not fingers. Sangria tasted like watered down Kool aid
"338|2|Served us main courses and appetizers at same time..wtf?  Those 4 plates wouldnt even fit on our table..Told them to take back main dishes until we ate appetizers..They come back with main dishes and food was barely warm and mashed potatos looked like a peice of plastic like one peice..Could pick up whole mashed potato with a fork, like a peice of steak...Terrible experience gave back our food spoke to manager..manager did get us 2 new dishes ..after 2 hrs we finally were finished eating..Not cool for an expensive place to eat.."
339|3|Just okay I think the food is not as fresh during lunch time. The fried fish isn't that crisp. Iced tea was not good. We also ordered pasta but the noodles seemed to be overcooked and soggy. I would advise to go at night BC the food was better when I came at night
"340|3|I've been here a couple of times, once for my nephew's birthday, and the second for a casual dinner. The first time ended up being a pleasant experience. Food was great and so was service. Wait time was pretty long but it was expected. The second time wasn't as good as it pretty much took too long for the food to arrive. It was cold. This place has so much potential for a chain and I hope management fixes these kinks soon because it does have a great ambiance, good food when served hot, and friendly service."
"341|2|3 hours to be seated. then the host  partially sat 5 out of 9 people. when  we arrived at the table . saw another table free, but was told it is a table for 10..... we said  we are 9 people and a baby and they refused to sit us there. then the host walked out on us leaving us standing awkwardly  there. when we complained the only answer was "" well we were trying to accommodate you""... . the host just left us there saying that she is not dealing with ""us""... the manager was worse trying to justify the host behavior instead of finding a solution.... only reason i agree to stay was this was a birthday surprise and kids were tired at that point... worse service ever."
"342|2|Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I met a friend here for dinner and I arrived before her and I was seated before she got there. I waited at my table for about 15 minutes and was not asked if I needed anything until she got there. Not even served a water. Once she arrived the waiter came up and we ordered. We got spinach dip as an appetizer and it was ok. We ordered our entrees as well. My chicken Marsala was fine, but she ordered the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. When she received it, it was simply chicken and noodles. There were no peas, mushrooms, pancetta, or tomatoes. We told the server and he offered to bring out the missing ingredients. We found this odd because we did not want a plate of the missing ingredients so we asked for it to be made again. After 45 minutes, we still had no replacement and we asked the waiter where it was. He said he would go check and another 20 minutes passed with nothing. We finally called for a manager and he went to check on it. 15 minutes passed and our food finally came out. The lady brought our food to the table, dropped it aggressively in front of my friend and said ""you're welcome"" without asking if it looked okay. She gave us no opportunity to say thank you and we were blatantly disrespected. We called the manager again and told him what had happened. He simply apologized and was not offering anything else. I had to tell him that I was not paying for her food and he finally said he would take it off and offered us cheesecake. I was ok with the outcome the manager offered, but I felt like this all could have been avoided if the staff here was professional and knew how to properly treat their guests. At the end of the day the rude lady who delivered our food caused the company to lose $30+ and she needs to understand that if she acts like that she should find a job somewhere else. I will never go to this location again and will think twice before going to any other location because I do not want to have to go through this ever again."
"343|2|VERY SLOW SERVICE. Went on a Wednesday night dinner. Came around 8:45 and left at 10:45. Stayed for 2 hours for dinner and we just ordered the main course and a couple of drink, no appetizers. Had to wait 30mis for someone to take our drink orders and waited for almost an hour for our food to arrived. This is after waiting for 30mins at least before being told that they ran out of one of our orders. The manager offered us a free cheesecake for the inconvenience but when I asked for the bill from another waitress as I can't seem to find where our waitress went, the complimentary cheesecake was billed until I pointed it out to our waitress. Have to get our cheesecake to go instead of eating it there as it was almost closing time. This is only after I stood up to look for the counter just to pay the bill so we can leave and remained standing by our table. Almost wanted to just walked out of there after paying the bill at the front instead. And to top it all, a party of 7 people arrived after us but got served and left before us. One of the slowest and baddest experience I had in a restaurant. Food was ok not even special. My sisters or friends will have to literally drug me to get me back to that place again."
"344|2|We had a party of 6, got there at 12, and waited over 2 hours to be seated (8:00). Fine. But then the waitresses were giving us a lot of attitude, unattentive, and looked downright annoyed. Took our order half an hour later and we finally got our food at 10:00. I got the Shrimp scampi and Steak combo (22$) and asked for a medium rare. I got three pieces of steak that were the size of chicken nuggets, well done, and three pieces of shrimp with a small scoop of potato mashed in the center of the plate. I'm sorry, but seriously? For $22?? The waitress was still giving attitude after she messed up my order. The manager came by and did nothing. No apology, nothing. I asked for a pasta instead, who which she said ""better late than never"" when she handed it to me. It might as well have been never because that shit was bland as hell, I dumped at least a teaspoon of salt and pepper onto it in order for it to taste like anything. Still, it tasted like flour. The cheesecake is grainy and so mushy it felt like I was eating custard. By the time we left, it was 11. Thanks for making us wait 4 hours for the shittiest meal I have ever had. I had better service at McDonalds."
"345|2|This is honestly the worst experience I had dining out!! I came out with a party of 7 to celebrate a birthday on a MONDAY!!! They told us the wait was 45 minutes and really we waited two hours. The manager was talking to our party about the whole situation but she was 0 help with anything, she told my boyfriend she would give us free cheesecake cause of the inconvenience but then the waiter told us the manager went back on what she said. When we finally sat down they did not give any utensils until we had to ask for it twice from different waiters. Then the food it self took almost an hour long and it was cold! The waiter kept on forgetting to bring us our drinks or any other thing we needed. After finally finishing our food we asked for the check they didn't give it to us, the waiter passed by our table a least 7 times and just kept ignoring us. This was terrible, the Cheesecake Factory was suppose to be a simple outing with family but ended up being an annoying dinner. We all agreed that this was a terrible idea and we will not be coming back here. If I could give this place 0 stars I would, I never write reviews but this place was the absolute worst!"
"346|2|We did go Saturday night for my brother's birthday. After waiting more than 1 hour for the table our waitress ask for drinks, we ordered 2 bottles of wine and place an order. The pouring of each glass was terrible, it seems as she wanted us to order 2 more bottles. When the food came 2 people were left without their order, one of them the birthday one. The waitress never came back to check, after 5 minutes we manage to get the attention of a manager and told him we were missing 2 plates. He came back 10 minutes later with only one, without a word he left, still no sign of our server, we wait another 10 minutes, and the person without a dinner call another server and told her she did not want her salmon anymore. 5 minutes later the server came back with the salmon, after been told we did not want it anymore, she left without an apology. When dinner was over we ask for her to light a candle for our birthday person, she came back with a glass filled with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. The food is ok, but not good enough to get the horrible service we experienced. We will never go back to that place or recomend it to anyone."
"347|2|Like someone said before me, this location stinks.  Went for lunch, ordered a sandwich and instead od fries I wanted a salad.  After about half an hour of waiting, someone brought me my sandwich and said my salad was not ready yet but she did not whant my sandwich to get cold.  What?  What can take so long to throw a salad together?  After I fnished half my sandwich my wairtress asked if I needed anything.  I told her I did not get my salad yet.  She came whit my salad and all that was in it were different lettuce leaves.  No tomatoes, no onions, no anything and this took 45 min.?  I waited sooo long for a Chessecake factory to come to NYC and now I know why it took so long, they know that the people in NYC are horrible workers.  Plus my dipping sauce that came whit my sandwich was in a coffee mug that was hal full and it was difficult to dip my sandwhich,  plus the mug had a brown ring arount the inside which could of been from the sauce or coffee.  Needless to say I did not dip my sandwich.  I felt like I was on the show th Worst Cooks instead od a restaurant."
"348|2|Okay first thing first the wait wasn't that bad so for the first time there I expected a longer wait it was like 15 minutes, the service was great the waitress was really happy (Isis). Then it went down from here after my girlfriend and I order, we order a appetizer (factory nachos) pasta and a burger (bacon bacon). The nachos took forever as the manager informed us and gave us a cheesecake for free yes great! Nachos were alright, we got our main dishes at the same time so my girlfriend and I couldn't enjoy it I expect the burger to be good and I'm gonna be honest that was the worst burger I ever ate in my life my girlfriend didn't feel good after she ate her paste at least the cheesecake was good but that took forever too.I don't know went wrong maybe it was the time we went I was so shocked cause I expected the best but maybe next you guys will be better thank sorry for the negativity just wanted to tell you what went wrong what should be fixed"
"349|1|I feel like this is a spot we've all been to at least once if you live in NJ. If you haven't, I definitely recommend even if you're a picky eater because odds are they have something you'll like in their 5000 page menu! There are so many options to choose from! The best way to describe Cheesecake Factory is as a slightly more refined diner and we jersey peeps love our diners!I went around 3pm thinking I'd be seated quickly but I guess I was wrong since the minimum wait time was 80-90 minutes. I recommend going right before you get hungry that way you can explore the mall while you wait and hit that sweet hunger spot right on time before your table is ready. We got the Tex-Mex Chicken rolls for an app which were absolutely delicious. For our main plates, we got the Carne Asada and Chicken Medira. Both were really large portions so sadly we did not have any room for any one of the signature cheesecakes. Overall, Cheesecake Factory is always a great go-to when you have no idea where you'd like to go to eat. My only qualms were the waiting time and the restaurant itself was actually a bit messy. There were a lot of napkins and things on the floor. However sadly, you really can't avoid waiting times during this new era of Covid we are now in."
"350|3|pros - the bartender whose name i forget. she has very short black hair. she was the busiest employee in the whole place and paid full attention to the guest sat @ her bar while being the only bartender on. food is great ! so the cooks are doing a great job keeping things consistent. i had the thai chicken salad and brussel sprouts. my dude had mozz sticks and penne alfredo with chicken. the food runners were polite. cons - the ""waiting line"" ... so you can't make a reservation. but you can put your name down and wait, logically i get it. but - we gave our #, didn't get a confirmation text. we were told it was a 70 minute wait, when of the available tables weren't being sat and dirty tables were not being bused.  (tables that could not be used for social distancing were clearly marked - so you could tell which tables were available for dine in)after 40 minutes we tried to see what the wait time was looking like - because a lot of tables were empty and not being sat again. we started noticing peoplewalking in and going straight to the bar - which we didn't know was an option. so we asked if that was part of the wait list orrrrr ? the manager with the slicked back 90s hair pretended to be surprised by it after telling us we had to wait - then magically 5 minutes later we were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar to eat. the 2 hostess were in lala land at the host stand pulling down their masks and making faces at each other. which was weird and unsettling to see. blonde girl and skinny girl on 10/30. they didn't seem to do much social distancing with customers. as they were right up next to people asking for their contact info."
"351|1|I've been meaning to come here for Happy Hour (Monday-Friday 4pm-6pm in bar area only) for quite some time. This is the best happy hour in jersey city and it's taken me this long to figure it out! Social distancing is in full effect here, so we appreciated being 6 feet apart from other patrons. We started with a round of happy hour drinks (Kane IPA $4.50) and (Mojito $6.95) were an amazing value! Mojito had fresh leaves in it and tasted authentic. Size of drink was really appreciated! They brought us fresh bread on the house which alone tastes like a million bucks after inhaling a drink. The only other place to bring out something on the house is a Mexican restaurant and that consisting of chips and salsa. We were impressed with the quality of the bread and ordered another round of drinks.....We started off with the Buffalo Blasts which were cooked perfectly and super crispy to perfection. The Buffalo sauce and blue cheese was tasty. For $6.95, the portion and value is unbeatable. We ordered another round of drinks and decided to split the Happy Hour Burger (upscale Big Mac). The burger is amazing, but we had to cut ourselves off after one bite and took the rest home because we were stuffed. We finished it for lunch the next day. Guys, this is a great happy hour if you're looking for a nice cold IPA and a refreshing cocktail that's not generic well alcohol, check this place out! Most Cheesecake Factory locations in the U.S. run the Monday-Friday 4pm-6pm Happy Hour. Check the website first! Our bartender was great and crafted a nice Mojito."
"352|1|When arriving, my friends and I were told that the wait for a booth would be 45-60 minutes. The host then told us that if we wanted one of the smaller, higher up tables, we would be seated right away. We ended up going with the smaller table since we were already super hungry and felt it'd probably fit us. The type of table we were at had 4-5 chairs around a round table but i'd definitely say that if you want to be comfortable and not feel crowded, sit at those tables only if you have a max party size of 3 (you'd probably be seated faster like us with a smaller party anyway). Any more than that and you'd definitely be elbow to elbow and have no space for all the plates/drinks. The service was actually phenomenal! To be honest, I was a little bit skeptical of how we'd be treated because of a negative experience another friend of mine had here in the past. However, we actually had a super attentive and very sweet waitress. Her tone was kind, and she answered any questions we had about the menu. The menu is HUGE but I ended up ordering the Fried Calamari for my appetizer and for my main dish I ordered the Chicken Costoletta with a side of fries. Later for dessert, I ordered a slice of Oreo Dream Cheesecake. The Fried Calamari appetizer was very ""eh"" at best. The breading didn't stick and was all over the place and I found myself dipping the Calamari into the marinara sauce or french dip to give it more flavor. The Chicken Costoletta with fries was incredible!  The chicken was breaded correctly, packed with flavor and the sauce was delicious. Fries are fries, but they weren't soggy, didn't taste overly salty and came in a little cup. The Oreo Dream Cheesecake was EASILY the best part of the entire night! They gave me a pretty huge slice with a giant Oreo cookie on top of it and a side of whipped cream. The chocolate top & bottom combo'd perfectly with the middle layer of cheesecake while the whipped cream served as a nice optional topping if I ever chose to add some. It was definitely a very satisfying way to round out the whole meal. If you'd like to try new menu items you haven't had before, I'd definitely recommend the ones I had with potentially a different appetizer as it was the one thing holding back my experience here from being higher."
353|1|2nd time coming here with a group of people. The food was delicious. Love the dim lighting and warm welcoming. We were greeted and seated with no wait. Will definitely return again. Did I say the food was delicious
354|1|We have lived in JC for a while... always looking for a new alternative to order in for dinner... we haven't yet ventured into in person dining during Covid. We ordered online direct from the CF website- a very extensive menu - places the order for pickup- drove over - they texted me on the way to say good was ready for pickup- drove up to curb - called the number and they came right out with our huge order! Raced home and everything was great and still warm! Food was great! Delicious as always and the pickup process was painless
"355|2|Such a great experience here started with a waiter who spilled coke on our clothes.The waiter didn't help us to wipe out the drink.Next, we got a broken glass.Next, we waited a loooong time for the order.And the order of course was messed up.We ended up paying a bill with no tips - and what a surprise - they cheated and put the higher numbers (so I opened a dispute - I have a photo of the bill - we shared expenses)Shame on you, liars!"
"356|1|I would highly recommend this place to anyone that's trying to give their tastebuds a great time. The host seated us quickly and we were instantly greeted by the nicest waitress in the world. The staff in this place seem to really enjoy their jobs and you can see that clearly in their work. We were constantly checked up on and asked if we needed anything and overall the service was phenomenal! Now to get into the food! I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken which is a charbroiled chicken with teriyaki sauce served with steamed rice (brown or white) and some veggies on the side. This dish tasted amazing and I was really impressed! To go with my meal I ordered a strawberry lemonade which came with free refills! The staff would check up on us constantly asking if we would like a refill or if they could remove a plate for us. The service was great and I just can't compliment it enough!! Throughout my photos you can see my friend's orders and they were just as impressed as me with their food! To finish off, I asked our waitress to surprise me with one of prettiest cheesecakes and she surprised me with one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tried. The celebration cheesecake is literally like a party in your mouth. Great selection from her and overall a great experience at this restaurant!"
357|2|We had reservation but they still make people wait out side in the garage.Finally we got table no utensils . Customer service is no goodly all. Food came cold.
"358|3|Service is hit or miss here. This past Sunday was a miss. Our waitress took forever to do everything. We were seated at the bar section, which looked pretty full. Maybe they need two people covering that area. Food was consistent - except the soup I had with the Renee's Special. It was so thick and salty. It tasted more like a chicken pot pie filling than a soup. Even so, I still like coming here for their lunch specials. It's a huge portion and a great deal. Plus is lasts til 5 pm, even on weekends. I had two Slice of Joy coupons for two free slices of cake. We had the Confetti cheesecake, which was too sweet. For the second one, we ordered a carrot cake at the to go counter. We ate it the next day and it was still good. Surprisingly, it's one of the better carrot cakes I've had. It isn't too sweet and all the nuts give it a nice texture.I'll be back! Hopefully service will be better next time."
"359|1|Always consistent! Great portions, price & variety. Their crab artichoke dip is delicious. I usually opt for their shrimp & angel hair pasta. Strawberry lemonade is a must"
"360|2|This place used  to be my favorite restaurant but tonight I  am Very disappointed very bad experience order food in this location ,the customer service and management need more improvement I have order food from this location at first they put me on hold like more then 10 minutes after the cashier have took my order I don't even finish ordering  yet she just hang up on me  what kind of  customer service is that When I arrived to pick up the food I was told to wait in the back and someone will bring me my food  While I was waiting I saw the chef was eating something in front of the cook line and he was licking his finger and  staff was talking in front of my food without mask on very disgusting my food has no lid on so I have told the manager I don't want that food I want get payment refund the manager said ok then he walk away without saying anything I was still waiting  for my foods but no one help me .....very bad customer service and management This how they pack my food without a lid on just 2 container w tape  on when I arrive home the sauce has all spill ... I will never order food from here again very bad experience"
361|1|Food is amazing. Great customer service ! The environment is very nice and every time I go it's always a win. The food is always fresh and hot and the waiters are very attentive !
"362|3|My girlfriend & I were shopping in the Newport Center and decided to stop here for dinner. We were quoted a wait time of 15 minutes for a table and ended up waiting about double that. The pros of the Cheesecake Factory are the portion sizes, the service, variety of choices & the obvious, the cheesecake. The cons of the factory are because of the variety, they may be compromising quality of every dish. For example, I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and it had great flavor but the shrimp  were way over cooked and were chewy as rubber. But other than that everything was solid. The maple bacon Brussels were my favorite as they had a sweet glaze with a nice crisp to them. We finished off the night with a s'mores cheesecake and it hit the right spot."
"363|1|I ordered from the skinelecious menu, since I'm on a restrict diet! Soft chicken tacos 300 cal, can bet that! Very well done, it comes with a side veggies, but it was very very spice, other than that the food was great!"
"364|1|Love cheesecake factory , their cakes and food is really great if you wanna celebrate birthday with some friends .I especially like that the prices are reasonable .I've tried the steak medaillion which I think was delicious and would recommend it ."
"365|3|Came here for lunch.  I had the Mushroom Burger.  It has Onions, Melted Swiss, Fontina Cheese and Mayo.  Also comes with fries, the burger is pretty juicy and the fries is crispy.  Didn't get a chance to have a cheesecake..  Will try that next time.  Overall my burger is pretty good and the service is good."
"366|2|I've been to several other Cheesecake Factory restaurants before; but this one was, by a long shot, the worst of them. I went around 18 months ago with three acquaintances, including but not limited to: my mom, my grandmother, and my brother. After getting laptops for school, we thought it would be great to get a bite to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. We were seated relatively quickly since we dined during slow hours. Dining during the evenings would have been an entirely different story. You would probably have to squeeze through people to get a seat as if you were getting a Barbie at your local Target during Black Friday sales. In other words, you would have to wait for an eternity to get seated since so many people eat at this place. The scenery was similar to other branches at which I have eaten - a relatively romantic, dark ambiance with cool napkins. Overall, a good eating environment, but nothing to change the way I perceive reality. Our server, who was male but I don't remember his name, was kind and attentive. That said, I have no complaints there.However, the most important part - the food - was a total disaster. My mother and my grandmother both ordered salad with ahi tuna; I ordered pot stickers; and for my brother, I forgot what he ordered. All three of our dishes were BEYOND DISAPPOINTING! The two ordered salads that had three pieces of tuna each. THREE PIECES...WHAT THE HELL!? To charge $18 for a salad, and then put enough tuna on there to barely satisfy a starving child in India, was outrageous. Are the chefs rationing the freaking tuna? Yeah, let me put 1 ounce of fish on a salad...great idea lol! Jokes aside, it was a mockery of a salad - ""the worst I ever had,"" said my poor grandmother in sorrow and depression. My potstickers were horse dung as well. They were entirely too salty and I could taste neither the contents of the filling nor the wrapping of the dumpling (I'm sure there's a culinary name for it but I have no clue what it's called). I don't know what type of glaze they put on there, but there was clearly an overwhelming proportion of soy sauce in it because all I tasted was salt. I would have had the potstickers plain, however Cheesecake Factory thought it would be a good idea to dump half a cup of the glaze on the pot stickers and not to the side in a separate dish, like any other restaurant. I was disgusted after the first bite, which forced me to drink like a college student at Coachella to wash away the taste from my mouth, and to hydrate myself because each bite was like gulping salt water. I feel genuinely awful for the waiter, because when he asked us how our food was, he was bombarded with complaints. My grandmother went off on how trash the salad was, and rightfully called the manager and gave him a piece of her mind, too. My mom also complained. I chose to refrain from complaining about my pot stickers because I am certain that the poor manager would have broke down crying if he heard what I had to say. The guy probably has war flashbacks that keep him up at night from what my strong, independent grandmother told him. Despite not knowing what he ordered, I recall that he was not too fond of his food as well.We didn't bother ordering desert because we wanted to get the hell out of this establishment as soon as humanely possible. Plus, as a runner, cheesecake would go straight to my thighs and glutei, not to mention the damage it would cause to my arteries. As a plus, the manager took the salads off the check, which was very kind of him to do. If I complained, I imagine he would have taken the pot stickers off, which would have made the bill less than $20 considering what my brother had ordered. A respectable gesture, but, to be fair, it should of been done if an upscale place like Cheesecake Factory messes up a salad - something that is very difficult to do as is. I have no culinary skill but can prepare a mean salad that would receive praise from my dear friend Barack. We paid the bill and provided a 20% gratuity to the kind waiter.As a whole, the experience was abominable. I am sure this place excels with its deserts and specialty items on the menu. However, such does not excuse how subpar the items were that we ordered. Perhaps we came on an off day? Even then, a well-known chain needs to be consistent with its quality of cuisine. I nearly forgot to point out that everything we ordered was overpriced. You don't charge $18 for a salad that has no premium ingredients on there, ever. I felt ripped off for my pot stickers, too, considering that I was not given enough to feel satisfied. I'm hoping this place has fixed the aforementioned problems over the past two years. I have not come back, nor do I plan on doing so for the time being. On a bright, summer evening, I was fondly disappointed as I sat in my burning hot car, reconsidering all of my life choices. Eating at The Cheesecake Factory was definitely a regret. Eat at your own risk!"
"367|2|Really not a big fan of their cheesecake. I hold a high expectation to their toasted marshmallow cheesecake but it turned out that the cook probably just put cheap chocolate and whole bag of sugar into that cake. A good cheesecake is supposed to melt in your mouth with thick flavor, but I tasted nothing from it but sugary bomb. And btw the marshmallow was a joke."
"368|2|My salmon was raw in the center, and while we were asking a waitress if we can cook it a little bit longer, she was holding a dirty dish and a butter knife fell off and hit my baby on the head. Needless to say he went crazy and she was apologetic of course, but honestly you should never hold food, drinks, or a tray of anything else over someone's head, let alone a baby's. (We also put the baby at an angle so he is as close to us as possible and not blocking the walkway. People were getting by fine.) Anywhoo, by the time my food came back, my friend was already finished with his meal and the baby was just miserable for the rest of our stay. I ate quickly but could not really enjoy. The servers may have been polite and briefly apologized, and I know they have other tables to attend to, but the situation of both the raw fish and a knife falling on an infant's head should have been brought to the attention of a manager (and it's part of their job to address it). My friend was pretty surprised that I was very calm about the whole thing (especially when it's your own kid because it just hits different) but really I was just in shock and exhausted by the end of it. We paid full price after everything, left +25% (because we're not THOSE people) and shot out of there. The end. Thanks for watching.Edit: Did what the response review told everyone else to do to go to their website and submit the issue. They don't respond or so do anything. Waste of time."
"369|1|Cheesecake Factory...sooooo don't know if I can logically give it less than a 4. Came in for just a slice and it was painless. No upsell, quick service, water, etc.The booth across from us wasn't cleaned up, but that's just me nitpicking. It had no affect on our experience at all. We also got way more whip cream than expected.Treat yoself."
"370|2|Cheesecake Factory used to be my favorite.  This one is a huge joke.  They charge $24 for a tiny entree, and the manager not only didn't address my issue with it, he tried to upsell me on buying extra sides to compensate for the fact that the entree was so tiny!  Lol what a joke"
"371|3|Eaten at this Cheesecake Factory a few times. Yesterday I stopped in for a slice of upside down pineapple cheesecake. Pretty good! My only ""issue"" was the woman not honoring my request for the slice I pointed out to her & she said ""ok"" (literally on one end of the cake vs the other). Not going to go back and forth over a slice, but listening goes a long way. There are other places to purchase sweet treats/baked goods at Newport mall. This experience made me feel like I'll just pass on the quick treat at CF next time."
"372|3|The food wasn't as exciting as once was for cheesecake.  It's become  too fast food driven and the service received reflects on that.  Build your own omelette and requested avocado on the side got us a huge plate that was sitting under a heat lamp baking the little pieces of avocado... Hot avocado?!? Gross! Smokehouse BBQ burger was good but it was to come with crispy onions that were more oil  than onion.  Finally waitress asked if we had room for dessert, I asked for black out cake to go and she repeated to confirm.  3 mins later she drops off the check and gives her farewells.  No cake! Granted, she didn't charge for it either but I definitely asked  for it smh.  All in all, it's changed with time and they aren't that high on my personal list anymore.  I won't be back."
"373|2|Wow .... when I say last nights dinner was a disappointment... it was a disappointment!  I wanted to buy something delicious for my family and automatically thought of The Cheesecake Factory.I don't want to write down a lengthy review however  I arrived for pickup waiting for the manager to get of the phone while there was another server in the back I guess cleaning up.. and after 5 minutes of waiting he is off the phone and I tell him my name he gives me two big bags of food I was so excited I was about to share this delicious food with my family. Fast forward we are eating the food of course we had to warm up the food because it was cold.The food had to no favor, the pasta had no sauce and the chicken parmigiana sandwich had the two smallest pieces of chicken in it ( more bread than anything) smh what a disappointment To make matters worst my mom was eating her broccoli and chicken pasta we substitute the rigatoni with linguine and she stops and pulls out a long white string out of  her mouth !!!! Disgusting... could've been a piece of cleaning rag could've been a string to hold meats together ... who knows !!!! Alll I know is that not sanitary and from that point on the food went to the garbage $100 plus down the drain .... the presentation of the plate when you open them plus everything I mentioned above .... brings me down to the fact that I willl never waste my money at that location again !!!!"
"374|1|I have been to this Cheesecake factory a couple of times when I was consulting in New Jersey. Overall it is a pretty good place to get a nice lunch. Compared to other Cheesecake Factories I have been to this one is fairly standard (but not in a bad way.)First let me say that whenever I come here it has always been uncrowded. This I assume is because I come during business lunch hours and people don't want to worry about waiting on food for a long time. The irony of this is that since people don't eat here the food actually comes out fairly quickly when I go. Since this particular restaurant is huge, but isn't particularly crowded when I go, the service has also been good to me. I don't have any complaints about rudeness or lack of attention when I have been here.What I can say though is that the food is great. Like a lot of cheesecake factories they have a huge menu and the dishes are fairly high quality. The pasta dishes in particular are some of my favorite. A long with the main entries they have also have amazingly fluffy and sweet brown bread for free! I am sure anyone who has been in a cheesecake factory before can attest to how great these are and it makes paying a little bit extra for the restaurant feel worth it. I have always liked the Cheesecake Factory chain and this particular branch seems decent. I would recommend this place if you have an hour lunch and are willing to spend a little extra for great food."
375|1|Very good place we tried the spicy chicken chipotle pasta in the chicken pot stickers with some white wine and pineapple cherry limeade it was amazing each dish was so well made it had so many flavours. The interior and ambience is pretty good as well it's a good place to go on a date. And the cheesecake oh my God we tried the chocolate mousse cheesecake and it was amazing it is like heaven in your mouth must try.
"376|2|Don't come to this place at all! If you're ordering something to go, you will be waiting about 30 mins to an hour. There is only cashier there and he/she has to go to the back and get all the orders to bring back to the front. They take forever. I called to place an order for a pick up and once I got there they didn't start it. I was waiting almost an hour for the guy to put whip cream around the cheese cake and requested that he redo it because it looked sloppy and it didn't look presentable. This wasn't the first time this happened. This place doesn't deserve any stars."
"377|2|This was my first time eating at Cheesecake Factory, and probably will be my last. The steak I ordered was supposed to be median rare, but it came luke warm and stiff as a plate of hard boiled chicken breast. The mashed potato was chunky and dry. I dare say I was served microwaved food. Service was slow (we did not get a water refill or a chance to voice our displeasure at the steak until very late, when we were almost finished. Even then, we had to ask for a refill specifically). If other people had good experience here and the horrible food + service was just me, then I will add that the waitress and staff are being racist against Asians. All in all, this was one of the worst restaurant food I have ever had."
"378|1|Went here as a last resort. Food is tour standard typical chain restaurant but a bit more flavorful. Had the bread and butter brough to the table. The aervice here was spectacular. Ordered the cajun spicy pasta substituted the bowtie pasta for angel hair... delicious! Also ordered chicken with rice and beans. Went there later, eo it was very calm. Good delightful experience and meals came out promptly."
379|3|The food is great but the service is too slow. The waiter and waitress are not attentive.
"380|2|Would not recommend coming during the holidays. My boyfriend and I decided on date night here because we had a gift card, but we regret it and wished we had saved it for another time. We of course expected it to be a little hectic and took that into consideration; however, the only thing that was okay about our visit was the easygoing server. We never got bread to start since ""the kitchen had burned the last batch of the night"" and our food took 45 minutes as ""something was overdone."" I heard this excuse given to 2 other tables. Everyone around me had grimaces lol and did not look like they were enjoying their meals. Once we finally got our food, my pasta carbonara was dry as hell. My boyfriend's brick chicken was still slightly over-charred and there was nothing crispy about the crispy potatoes. The food took so long that we couldn't even order cheesecake to go. I'd be willing to try out this place again in a couple months to hopefully avoid this experience again."
"381|2|Dear Lord!!!!! I swear Worst CCF in the country. I think I've been to about a dozen in the USAThis place is so bad, that female brunette manager is the one giving this place the bad reviews. There's always a problem at this location. $7 a slice of cheesecake and the cake was so small, and had remnants of it wiped on the side. Good came out cold, Hard to eat cold French fries, it was terrible. I gave this place 2 chancesThe gen mgr which is a male helped us last time.He was acting like a managerAnd i hate having to ask for a manager. I'm not a big complainerMost restaurants fix the problem mostly the servers. This is the WORST location. I really am not a complainer. I'm so passive. Definitely don't take a date or celebrate a special occasion at this oneGo to another."
382|1|The strawberry martinis here absolutely give me life ! As well as all the cheesecake they have which is amazing i like the turtle or pumpkin when the mood strikes... the food is also amazing pictured is the honey truffle chicken over mashed potatoes and asparagus
"383|2|Horrible service. Waited 45 mins for a table to have dinner with my child and his food literally came out before I even placed my order. The server basically put his food in without waiting on my order. Then my order comes out with a garnish I specifically asked twice for the server to have the chef remove. Like unreal. I didn't even get to eat a morsel of my meal. The manager, Daisy then comes to the table and really could care less and blames it on the time of day and that they are winding down for the night - LIKE WTH does that even mean!? You're open give great service and that's it - despite Covid despite anything, take accountability!"
"384|3|Cheesecake Factory in general is an underwhelming place for New Yorkers. However, outside of New York, it is a great place to catch up with friends and family and feel a little bougie doing so (without spending the bougie bucks). The food overall, is average. However, three things you MUST have at any Cheesecake Factory. Bread, Fried Mac and Cheese Balls, and Cheesecake. I recommend the the celebration cheesecake, but that is just me. The staff in any cheesecake factory makes you feel like you are in the Disneyland (once again, without the expenses). Whenever I want to catch up with friends outside of New York, you betcha I am going to a cheesecake factory. Especially after I had a good two hour session at the gym."
"385|2|I don't know is it just me or not. but we come her at least once a month. but the last 3 times was a nightmare. while the food was good . service was terrible, tonight we decided to try our luck again. after we got sat down . we waited a full 15 minutes and not a single server came to ask for drinks or greet us. this time I'm sick of it . me and my wife just grab our jackets and walked out the door. probably wont go back for a very long time."
"386|1|Wish they'd stop being so stingy with the sauce. The drinks do not get you drunk or even tipsy, I wonder if they even put liquor in them for real or.  The food is good tho and it's not really busy during the week."
"387|2|Our Server was so great, and food was delicious. I just wish the hostess was a little more gracious. We called and they said they didn't take reservations, it was walk in only, but half hour wait. So we get there, put our name down and party. Larger parties were going in, and we asked a few times, how much longer, it was always 5 more, 10 more... in total we waited ONE HOUR AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES. Completely unacceptable. But to the rest of the staff working: thank you."
"388|1|Awesome! The food was great the location was beautiful. We sat immediately, no wait time. It was just how i remember it."
"389|3|We got the chicken pot stickers, chicken samosas, salmon, beet and goat cheese salad, and the crispy chicken sandwich. Everything was good overall and the ambiance is what you expect from a Cheesecake Factory. We came in at around 7pm on a Tuesday and were seated promptly at a booth. During our meal I have to say the service was on the slow side. Drinks specially took quite a while to come out though water was refilled promptly. The chicken potstickers had a bit too much vinegar in the sauce but tasted ok. The chicken samosas were fine but tasted like they were missing something. Could definitely used more of a kick for my taste. The beet and goat cheese salad was probably the favorite dish of the night.From the entrees, the salmon was just ok and the crispy chicken sandwich was just better than average. The fries were just ok.I had a couple of old fashioned's with my meal and they were not bad. Better than what I expected.We did not have dessert."
"390|2|This is probably last time We will visit to Cheesecake Factory due to poor services we got thereWhen we went there wait time was 20 min OK  still we tolerated and sat for  35 minWhen we got table  being vegetarian we asked for Veg Berger and beerWe were served beer with flat bread which were ordered Then lady who took our orders came with information that do not have veg Berger's as they do not made today As we have already started taking beer we were not able to go to next Berger barWhen we ordered vegi pasta and Soft tacos we were served very tasteless dishes with some boiled cauliflower without any dressingOn the top of this we were charged for Chiken Pasta and chiken TacosBill no 0728Table 3319:54 on 21Dec2018If you are vegetarian do not visit to this worst Factory at all and shell out hefty dollars for nothingAdd to this complementary bread with cheese was served along with main course as they said bread was in oven ????????Hope they will improve I just checked Chiken taco dish photo and then I realized they have really cheated us No beans,no guacamole side of taco Stuffing was just few leaves of lettuce no dressing"
"391|1|Good place for good food. Portion are generous. Menu is extensive. So much to choose from. I had jambalaya which had shrimp and chicken. Its one of best dish at Cheesecake factory as in my humble opinion. By time I finish with that I would not find room to eat cheesecake. I really cannot remember last time I had a cheesecake there. Portion of food is so much, no room for anything else. I was looking at menu items and seems many items are over 2000+ calories. But this is the good place, if you want to have somewhat nice place to sit down and have good meal."
"392|1|The Cheesecake Factory is high class chain restaurant that has many options to eat.  It has a wide variety of food that is prepared and presented very well.  I have been to many locations and this one in Newport mall is a smaller one but the good is still very good.  The workers there are very friendly and helpful. The ambiance is like its other locations, very cozy and intimate.  It does get crowded and you might be waiting some time for a table during peek dining hours.  The food is flavorful a little on the pricey side but it's a better option then most chain restaurants if u don't feel like cooking.  Don't forget to grab yourself a slice of cheesecake heaven.  I don't even like cheesecake or sweets like that but I tried a slice of the salted caramel cheesecake.  WOW!!!! It put me in another atmosphere the lady next to me was laughing Bc my eyes were rolling to the back of my head....yes that feeling!!! Lol."
"393|2|We ordered the Loaded Baked Potato Tots and the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, but only received our appetizer. Our waitress came by twice, to take our orders and to check up on us. It has been almost an hour and we didn't receive our entree, she told us it was on the way. After a while of waiting, another waitress noticed me looking for our waitress. She gave us some water and said she will check up on our pasta. We waited. It still didn't come so we just decided to just call for the check because it's ridiculous, we only ordered 2 items and even asked for them to be brought out together. The place wasn't even that packed and I would be more appreciative if our server gave us an explanation at the very least. The manager came and told us we didn't have to pay and was allowed to leave. I guess that was because we only received our appetizer. The food there isn't bad, but the service tonight was horrible."
"394|2|Called in ordered for pickup, Angel hair pasta with shrimp. This is what got for $19.50. It's so nasty and only four shrimp, disgusted. FOUR shrimp really!! So disappointing never again!"
"395|1|Honestly I know it's not trendy but this place  great every time. We come for dinner sometimes with the kids, very kid friendly. We come for the happy hour special also. It's always packed. The food is delicious, even the healthy items. The drinks are well done and the vibe is fun."
"396|1|Service is always great here. I had lunch on Friday here with my friend, the strawberry lemon aid is AMAZING! the wings fries and max and cheese! Amazing for 2 people it felt like a little bit of food, until we began eating it, and we couldn't finish it all! I took a chocolate mousse to go. Not my fave, like the red velvet! But I was in a mood to try something new. Will be back again, since your located in the mall and the staff is always friendly! See you soon CheeseCake Factory"
"397|1|Finally convinced my bf to go here and it proved itself like I knew it would! The skinny margarita and pineapple Moscow mule-- both great though on the sweeter side. Mac and cheese balls and cheeseburger spring rolls -- both awesome, especially the spring rolls. Brussel sprout app we had as a dinner side -- fantastic. Arugula flat bread (I got without prosciutto) was delicious and the crust was soooo tasty. He got the crispy chicken with pasta dish, which got better with each bite. And lastly, the cheesecakes, which we got to go. I always get the Reese's one (loved it like always) and he got the cinnamon bun one which he was still sneaking bites of this morning. The only downside was that the cheesecakes were much smaller than I've gotten in the past, though I haven't been here in a couple years. They used to be twice the size. This is probably for the best though..."
"398|1|Idk what is with these negative reviews?! We had the best early dinner (5pm) tonight, the happy hour is great and service couldn't have been better at the high top tables. The nachos were huge and so delicious and the crab dip was excellent as well. Both were 1/2 off- how can you be upset about that? Also the brown bread to start is seriously the best, I actually would buy a loaf. We also got a small Greek salad which was more of a chopped salad than an actual salad- it had olives, feta, cucumbers, red onion and some lettuce. It was fresh and the perfect side addition. We seriously had such a good dinner- we will be back!"
"399|1|My friend recently moved to an apt building 5 minutes away from here and I will never miss out on an adventure to check out the Cheesecake Factory. We came here for lunch, and when dinner time came, despite not being hungry, we scrolled through Seamless for half an hour until we decided to order from the CF twice in one day. The food from this chain is alway decent but never exceeds expectations other than with its sheer portion size. The inaptly named Skinnylicious menu should just be the regular menu. Even the Superfoods section consists of dishes well over 1k calories. Flavorwise, both the vegan cobb and the salmon salad are tasty, and so is the free bread. My bf's buffalo cauliflower also smelled amazing. Service is generally slow for both dine-in and take-out."
"400|3|It was a party of 15 and we called in advance to let the hostess know that we were on our way. When we arrived, they were no longer able to sit us together that we had to wait 2 hours. We were all waiting to eat, starving I should say and then for someone to tell us that we had to wait 2 hours just to sit. That was horrible. It worked out though, we managed to sit in 3 different tables right next to each other and the waitress, Britney was AMAZING! She worked very hard to make sure we all received what we asked for. Her communication with us was on point and her great attitude made this experience good. The food was too salty for some of the family but the pasta was great for others. I guess it's just this location. We shall see."
"401|3|Shared some appetizers - avocado egg rolls, fried shrimp, and chicken samosas. Generally speaking they were pretty good.For entrees the portion size is ridiculous - if you had appetizers and want to save room for dessert, there's no way to finish a pasta dish without having some left over. I had the Louisiana chicken pasta, which was very tasty but a little bit on the oily side.For dessert we shared a selection of cheesecakes. True to its name, the Cheesecake Factory does make pretty good cheesecakes."
402|1|Food is good. No delays in order. Salmon is well cooked and everyone in the team enjoyed the lunch.
"403|1|Great start to our visit - being told there was a 20 minute wait! Yes, il take that! My husband was flying out of Newark so we decided to have a meal at Cheesecake Factory beforehand. We were worried we wouldn't be able to fit it in, but were pleasantly surprised at the wait time, especially compared to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants that we have been to. We grabbed our drinks at the bar and soon after we were seated. My husband had the grilled chicken tostada salad and I had the Kobe burger. The portions were huge, so we didn't make it to the cheesecake, but we really enjoyed our meals. My burger had great flavor and was really juicy and I loved the fries!! They were so good. Everything on the salad looked so colorful and fresh. We were very full and didn't even manage to finish! I'm already planning my return already!"
"404|3|Not the best one I been so far,  it takes forever to bring the food and when the food came was cold. The waiter bring our drinks and didn't put the straws I have to ask for it. The cheesecake that I order taste like butter I wonder if they change the recipe or just on this restaurant."
"405|2|They served us meat despite telling the server we're vegetarians!!!!This place has been my go to place after any movie I watch in the AMC theatre nearby. So yesterday this very kind server 'Jonathan' asked for our order and me and my husband politely told him we're vegetarians and wouldn't prefer meat. We ordered tomato basil pasta. Despite telling him we're vegetarians, he brought us chicken pasta and we accidentally ate it. So after a bite or two, I had my suspicions and called up my server and asked him if this was chicken. Now, I don't mean to sound obscene but the balls on him, he was so cool about it and answered with a nod and a very unpleasant attitude! So rude! He didn't have the basic courtesy to apologise. That disgusted me even more. I pushed the plate away and walked out of the place while my husband paid the bill. Never coming back here again!It's not cool to toy with people's believes. Serving meat to a vegetarian and disrespecting your customer is the worst thing you can do while running a restaurant. Such a bad experience."
"406|3|Food is great but the service SUCKS. After sitting at our table for 20+ mins, receiving our kids meal and app, we had to ask our waiter for our waters and complimentary bread.Now, we've been here for about 45 mins and we're still waiting on our entrees while the table around us have been served (yes, they got here after us). I'm at the point where im not even hungry anymore and i just want to grab the check and go. It's even worse that the waitress for the table next to us keeps checking in on them and the food they already received, while we have to flag down our waiter."
"407|1|I know this is a chain, and therefore I expect it to be like the others I've tried. The smell of the restaurant was unpleasant walking in, so my expectations were low. Our server was amazing, she made helpful suggestions. The food was actually pretty good. I enjoyed 2 mojitos, very refreshing! The cheesecakes were perfection! For mall food, overall, I was pleased."
408|1|I don't wanna sound like I'm overrating this place but you got to give it up for consistency. Rarely have I been to any of these chains and been disappointed. Lately I mainly die for happy hour which is the best deal around. They have the best apps in general and during HH you get them for 5-6$. Long Island iced teas are the same and I can get nice and toasted with good food for cheap prices. I recently had the short rib sliders which were bomb for the price. And you can't go wrong with avocado egg rolls either. Overall the value for happy hour specifically is why I gave it a higher rating. 3.8/5
"409|2|I have been here several times-mostly sitting at the bar (after and during shopping at the mall)and the service is always just acceptable. No warm greetings, no pleasantries, no smiles ever. Maybe the staff here hate their jobs. At least at Zinburger a few feet away, the bartenders and management make an effort to remember you. What's worse-at no time after my drink going empty have I EVER been offered a second drink...any of the times I've been there. Is this the only place in the world the bar and the bartenders don't need your money?! I always tip generously regardless, but I always leave with a bad taste in my mouth."
"410|1|First time ever trying the Cheesecake Factory last night!  My girlfriend and I were very impressed.  We went in knowing that's it's a chain and honestly didn't know what to expect.  Had to wait maybe 10 mins and then we were seated.  The restaurant is pretty dark with dim lighting and decorations which were relaxing. When first looking at the menu, you're immediately overwhelmed by the amount of options and different types of food (American, Asian, Mexican, Italian, Southern, etc).  There's literally a choice for everyone.  Even though it took us a good half hour just to decide what to eat, we made some good choices with the help of our server and we were not disappointed!  The food was delicious and the portions were enormous!  Topped off the dinner with a slice of their famous original cheesecake and I have to say it may have been the best cheesecake I've ever had.  Great experience, not too expensive, and we'll be coming back."
"411|2|Why is everything so sweet there!!!!! Right from tacos to burgers to pastas, everything is sweet! Go there for the flat bread and the Tex Mex egg rolls. Its just a confusing menu with tasteless dishes."
412|3|I'm giving Cheesecake Factory 3 stars not because I think it's a great place overall but it is one of the better ones when compared to other CF locations. The wait is a bit long but the service here is much better than other locations.The food is pretty much the same as other CF locations but they do pay better attention to detail when it comes to special requests. The variety of cheesecake compared to other locations is a bit lacking.
"413|2|I know too many words! When I came to Yelp to show my cousin pictures of the food I didn't understand the 3 stars overall rating. This is my 4th or 5th time here and today may be my last! When I arrived with my cousin and our two 7 year olds we were seated on the ""patio"" at the outside corner table as soon as you walk through the doors, very visible. Per our usual we ordered the kids' meals first. I ordered the salmon for mine and realized that our server never asked what kind of veggies she wanted. We could see her putting the order in so I ran all the way to the other end to update her. Whew! We would've ended up with carrots and mashed potatoes, but the waiter changed it to fries and broccoli and I watched her do so. When she came back to our table she informed us that they ran out of broccoli, leaving both of our girls disappointed. My mini-me does not eat all veggies unless they are cooked a certain way so I knew any other offering would be a problem. So I asked for a small caeser salad with no cheese and we put in our app order. After the girl's got their food sans the salad, the waiter said her manager was insisting on charging for the salad substitution. Really?!?! So I asked to speak to this hooligan. Smh 15 minutes later and no manager, no salad, then the waiter said she'd bring one and eventually she did. We put our main order in after we received our apps and waited a good 25-30 minutes for the entrees. I wish I would've taken a picture, but my meal looked like my 1st grader plated it. I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair with a spaghetti substitution. Boo for me because I was given angel hair which to me might as well be real hair! I was still willing to eat it as long as the flavor of garlic, herbs, and basil was there as promised, but sadly no. The pasta was bland and literally tasted like tomato sauce right out of a can. The ""sautéed"" shrimp, which were bone dry and placed around the plate like the numbers on a clock were also lacking seasoning. They were so white, dry and flavorless that I'm having a difficult time calling them shrimp and definitely NOT SAUTÉED shrimp. For two seconds I thought about taking it home and fixing it, but reality struck that there was no amount of garlic or salt and pepper to fix this $20 meal. I informed the waiter that I couldn't eat it because the pasta was wrong and it lacked everything promised in the menu. I also informed her that they brought out mashed potatoes and not the french fries (luckily mini-me eat the mashed ones) as requested and that overall this was a bad experience for me. I did order cheesecake to go and told her I guess that would be my dinner. The manager never came and checked on us even after returning my meal. No one ever offered to make this right. We still tipped the waiter even though she could've been way more attentive, but she did the best she could in dealing with the situation with no support from her manager. If I return I will stick with the miso salmon I recommended to my cousin which was good and the tuna dishes which are also always very consistent. Who cooked my nasty shrimp pasta??? Please send them back to first grade."
414|1|I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times in last 2 years but the best food I had was in one of my most recent visits. Here is what we ordered from the never ending menu :1. Guac and chips - Rating - 8/102. Spicy chipotle veggie pasta - out of this world amazinggg 100000/103. Veggie flatbread - 7/104. Cucumber lemonade - too sweet - 5/105. Coffee cheesecake - 10/10I'll highly recommend the spicy chipotle veggie pasta if you are a vegetarian like me and loves spicy food. Ambience is always good at any cheesecake but I'm taking a star off for the slow service.
"415|3|This Cheesecake Factory is very average, wouldn't say amazing and wouldn't say bad. I got the Pasta Carbonara (non-lunch menu) and it was decently sized. It was flavorful, leaning on the a bit too creamy flavorful, and otherwise pretty standard. It was very average, and exactly what I expected."
"416|3|Food is great, but I have to stop dine in this particular location. Because the smell of cleansing product from tables and floor is too strong!!! I'm not sure if the employees there notice it anymore, but it is unbearable for me to have lunch at a place that smells like bathroom. Do something please. I really love you guys but can't have food there. Your waiting staff needs tip money as well. Please don't let me order takeout anymore."
417|2|The restaurant has a mouse problem. We saw one under the table. Server told us they don't know what to about the mouse problem and that the mice are friendly.
"418|1|This is was my first time coming here and I wasn't dissapointed. Everything from the bread, to the pasta to the cosmopolitan to the cheesecake was great. The service was great as well."
"419|3|Still a lot of waiting around. I almost wish there was a better timer to manage it - the bread and the delays in drinks didn't help.Fried avocado/mushroom/zucchini appetizer came 20 minutes after my pasta...odd. I would've canceled it had Antonella not been so nice about it.The Pasta da Vinci is actually quite good - not nearly as salty and a very mild sauce with mushrooms and chicken balancing the penne. Better experience, though portions seem to have gotten smaller - the last time I had pasta here, it was 2x the meal."
420|1|The ceaser salad dressing was too garlicky for my liking. The chicken in the pot pie was so juicy and the creamy sauce was rich and tasty. The fettuccine was on point and we had Chris outrageous cheesecake to go.
"421|3|We came over for brunch and we ordered traditional Benedicts, for huge fans of Benedicts on the brunch I must say those were the worst, I would never recommend to order it. Despite on that, I still love this place for for evening, homely atmosphere and for the service which is wasn't bad, but not excellent as well, we had to ask for bread to the dish it should be served with and we never got water on the table. However, There is one appetizer I would come there for Sweet corn trample cakes. It's it just a gem hidden in the huge ocean of the restaurant's menu! You just gotta try it! Interior: 5/5Service: 3/5Food: 3/5"
"422|2|Roommates and I decided to treat ourselves with cheesecake after a day of studying. Why not The Cheesecake Factory? Little did I know that they are very slow and the customer service was awful. I gave the benefit of the doubt because it could be a busy night at The Cheesecake Factory. My patience runs out when it take over an 1.5 hours to cut three slices of cheesecake, which might already be cut, and pack it to give it to the delivery person. Maybe because it was doordash, but at least the driver picked up the phone. The hostess was good, but couldn't really help me. I was on the phone for 12 min waiting for someone at the bakery to pick up because I was concerned that the ice cream might have been melted. Guess what, no one picked up. I would understand if the kitchen was backed up, but I know the cheesecake is in a separate area of the restaurant. Good thing I go to Newport Mall a lot, so I can avoid this place because this ruined my night."
"423|2|I'm very disappointed of this place knowing that they have OK food and desserts.Service was very sloppy, which I understand if you are bored why even bother to come to work. Food took way too long to serve and it was just pasta and cold bu the way!  I really feel disgusted by the service and food. This is the reason I give 1 star and not even deserve it. You better off going to Panda."
"424|3|Great Passion Fruit Mojito to celebrate my birthday!Brunch took entirely too long to come!Dirty utensils and drinking glasses.I was going to purchase 3 slices of cheesecake, but left in a hurry out of sheer disappointment"
"425|3|Ordered to go food:Food:  I ordered chicken lettuce wrap and beet goat cheese salad.  The food was okay.  I was disappointed with the lack of avocado in my lettuce wrap (see picture).  The flavors of the salad were pretty well balanced and adequate.  The goat cheese blended well w the beets.  3/5Service:  they took my order really quickly but the pain was in the waiting time. It has been over 32 min for a simple to go order.  It is on Tuesday night at 9:38pm when I came in and it was slow for them. This is a bit ridiculous! Manager needs to pay attention to this kind service. With such a small simple order, it should never ever take this long especially for a professional chain restaurant.1.5/5Atmosphere: your typical chill cheese cake factory. It is a smaller location than others.  4/5"
"426|1|This location was a lot busier than the others I usually go to, but they handle the crowd well. Our server did get several tables at once, so the service did get a little slow at one point. Aside from that this is what I've come to expect in terms of quality from Cheesecake Factory!One important thing to note is that parking is expensive here. Not that it's any fault of Cheesecake Factory, but still it is important to know."
427|1|Serena W. was excellent food was great. Best dinning experience in a while. Will come back soon.
"428|2|So today, April 2, 2018...I get a seemingly insincere apology from management in response to my experience. That apology is the same apology sent to other disappointed and frustrated patrons. I'm not satisfied and I still will never return to that location. Obviously management is doing a poor job making good on promising better, as nothing has improved at this location."
"429|1|I am actually rating Cheesecake Factory in Willowbrook mall. The customer service was superb. Went there to celebrate my brother's graduation and accidentally left my professional camera. Only realized it an hour after I got home and they saved it there for me until the next day. So appreciative!!! Tomato Basil Pasta is always great, but it is a huge portion. My husband is Dominican and he loved the Dolce de Leche cheesecake. I loved the caramel royale macchiato.....pretty sweet!"
"430|1|Who doesn't love cheesecake from the cheesecake factory? This location is open past midnight, has a lovely & familiar ambiance and of course has an amazing selection of cheesecake. The rest of the food can use a little bit of work (ahem) but late night cheesecake in a nice restaurant makes this superbly worth it :)"
"431|1|its awesome..always consistent Great food, service is irrelevant.  Its a chain and doesnt force me to wear good clothes like the next door Ruth Chris did."
432|2|The service wasn't the best very sub-par. For example our server didn't think we needed a full set of utensils and when we asked we got 1 knife from a random table from a random staff person who I had to flag down. He seemed annoyed and I could relate. Drinks came out quickly which helped with my sense of annoyance but a server not serving and then ghosting us kind of...sucked.
"433|3|Took an hour and a half long trip to this Cheesecake Factory after calling and speaking to someone about birthday specials, specifically a complimentary slice since it's my birthday. The person who answered the phone assured me that I would be given a complimentary slice. This was enough for me to take the trip because who doesn't want all of the bday trinkets. One star lost because an hour an a half travel later, after being seated, my waitress told me that they only offer a scoop of ice cream for birthdays, which would be fine had I not been given an another answer hours before. I did ask someone at the front and he checked with a manager and so it was true, my trip to the cheesecake factory for a birthday slice was a waste so there was that. I eventually took the ice cream scoop to go and they did try to jazz it up with sprinkles and chocolate sauce. I just would not have made the trip on this occasion to celebrate because it was a big disappointment, after all no one goes to the cheesecake factory for ice cream but I guess. I had the Chicken Bellagio for dinner and it was quite nice. The pasta was al dente, the chicken was perfectly fried and the arugula was tossed in a nice dressing! My biggest disappointment with the dish was the lack of flavor in the pasta. It was coated in a basil dressing or oil and on the sides of the plate was a cream sauce which was very well needed throughout the entire pasta part of the dish. Without it, the pasta was bland and just there. I didn't have time to make any suggestions or ask for more of the sauce but maybe on my next visit, whenever that may be since it is out of the way, I will do so. Service was attentive and right. The host even prepared a table for me and truly took her time to wipe it down. That is important because some people just dont care however 1 hour until closing she gave great effort. The service is 5 stars solid but the miscommunication between customer and staff via the phone and the lack of flavor in the main part of the dish brought it down. I would still suggest you visit if you'd like just don't expect cheesecake from the cheesecake factory for your birthday even if you called ahead. Read yelp reviews instead."
"434|2|Overall it wasn't bad or good. Seems like other Cheesecake Factory locations have better food, cleanliness and service. Some changes in personnel and proper training can go a long way at this location. Skip for now."
"435|2|Came for brunch on a Sunday. We were promptly seated and they brought our bread right away. I ordered the chicken and waffle eggs Benedict and my mom got the brûléed French toast. DO NOT EVER ORDER THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES FRENCH EGGS BENEDICT. The hollandaise sauce was so thick and tastes congealed. It got all over everything and just grossed me out. I barely finished my meal, and even then I was scraping that sauce off of it. My moms French toast was good. It was very thick and sweet, but pretty decent. Overpriced for only two slices but we did enjoy it. I wouldn't go back for brunch."
"436|2|Very disappointed with the service. First, no body even asked us for waterSecond: Appetizers and main course was served together (that too after 30 mins)Third: Drinks were served towards the end of our meal."
437|1|Ive heard mix reviews about this location from their initial launch to some reviews on here already. Came by a few weeks ago with some of my favorite amigos and must say we left super full and satisfied. We had about a 10 minute wait before being seated which was a little confusing because it was 2pm on a week day and it wasn't a full restaurant. We finally sat at a booth really enjoyed that you can look right into the kitchen as they are busy preparing peoples meals. We were greeted by our waiter who seemed nice. We orders some apps and cocktails everything came out pretty good. We waiting a while for our food but at this point we really should have just stopped at apps because we were pretty full. Service was okay nothing majorly great about it. I would definitely come back if I was in the mood for a chain restaurant. Its nice to know that is right at the mall so you know do not have to travel to other locations.
"438|2|Worst experience ever. We had a work lunch on a Friday at 1 o'clock. We had called before to get a reservation, but were told they don't accept reservations after 1. Yet while we waited a group came in after us and said they had a reservation and were immediately seated. We had a substantial wait even though there was a large amount of open tables. It then took over an hour for our mediocre entrees to arrive. My burger was like a child's meal. What happened to the large portions Cheesecake Factory was known for? We asked for the check with our meals as we had to get back, and the waitress screwed that up too. Never again!!"
439|2|Everyone always talks about the Cheesecake Factory as if it is this great place so as soon as I seen it was now in Jersey City I made an effort to go. I had such high expectations for this place but sadly I was very disappointed. Service: The wait time was an hour but since the restaurant was new it was understandable. But the wait time also made me expect more...and honestly it was not worth the wait. The waiter was nice and friendly but when I asked her if she could recommend something she said everything was good and they had lots of specialties....umm wrong answer ...sigh. The menu was so long I really wanted a recommendation. Food: The Fried Macaroni appetizer was incredible. For my entree I ordered the chicken Marsala. When it arrived I noticed my pasta was extremely over cooked. I tried to eat it anyway but I just couldn't it tasted horrible so the waitress took it back and nicely removed it from the bill. I doubt I will return here and am disappointed in my first cheesecake factory experience.
"440|2|Never was one to go out of my way to write a negative review but the service here on a slow Monday night at 8pm was the worst I've ever had. My husband and I just wanted a quick bite, so we ordered two of the same burgers cooked the same way exact way. The only difference is I ordered sweet potato fries and he had regular fries. Easy enough right? Wrong. Waited almost an hour for the two burgers. Meanwhile other customers that were seated after us got their food. We asked several times about our food and waitress kept saying it was on the way. Finally our food comes I'm guessing the manager on duty brings it out and there was no fries, and no bacon on the burger. So she had to go back to kitchen. That's just the first time. Second time brings the burgers but still the wrong order! No sweet potato fries. So she literally had to come back 3 times just to get our order right. I didn't even mention when we sat down my utensils were dirty and asked for new ones and the waitress never replaced them. I'm pregnant and starving I didn't even care at that point, I just wanted to finally eat, after a long hour+ of waiting. Manager did offer us a piece of cheesecake and apologized but still reeling from the terrible customer service. I work in customer service it's just such a shame when you get terrible service back. I was so tired from the long day I just wanted to pay and leave. But thinking back I should have remembered that manager's name so hopefully they can work on the terrible service here. I've been to this location many times, the service and food used to be great. But now I would definitely think twice coming back."
"441|3|This review is for both dine in and takeout. My first experience here was dine in, my date and I were seated promptly, waitress was very helpful and well mannered. As an appetizer, we chose the Tex Mex egg rolls. I ordered the farfalle with pancetta, mushrooms, and chicken (minus the peas and carmelized onions that usually come with it). I also opted for spaghettini instead of farfalle and my waiter graciously accepted my alterations. My date went for the chicken alfredo. Both dishes came to us piping hot, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. The Cheesecake Factory goodness that I fondly remember from years ago. Unfortunately my delivery experience was far from as pleasant as the dine in.Last night, via DoorDash, my date and I went for TCF again. He went for the turkey burger with cheese and french fries on the side. I went for the same pasta, instead I got shrimp instead of chicken in it. The food came fairly cold, there were still onions in mine, the shrimp was tough and cold, and they didn't put any pancetta in even though I didn't ask for that to be removed. There was also no sauce in it. It seemed like they made the dish in a pan, drained the remaining sauce and let it sit and dry out for 30 minutes. My date's burger was a little cold but seemingly good, although the fries were no dice; soggy and cold. I know that I had a few alterations but I really can't see myself sending out a such a crappy dish like this, being in their place. Can't see myself ordering delivery from ever again. Not exactly fun spending almost $20 a mediocre, hardly edible dinner."
"442|1|Hard to choose since so many items on the menu. Their pastas are great and salad too and everything!!! Now, you get to decide what cheesecake to order because why go to The Cheesecake Factory and not have a piece. No bad decisions here just the fact that this White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake has 1560 calories per slice. I do admit that this is an excellent dessert!"
"443|1|Wide selection, adequate portion size, above-average taste, okay service, affordable price."
"444|1|I ordered the spaghetti carbonara with chicken. The food was okay, I'd give it 3 stars. However, the customer service was excellent. Management was able to accommodate our party of 10 with ease."
"445|1|First time coming to Cheesecake Factory! Great experience, service was great very attentive. Super friendly staff overall. The food looked good and tasted even better! Must try the cheesecakes! I got the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and it was to die for! 10/10 would definitely come again!"
"446|1|Seriously the best experience I've had here ever. Always loved this place so this review is overdue. Just had the chicken parmesan sandwich, like holy $#%T it was awesome. Our waiter Yival was 5 stars and my chocolate hazelnut cheesecake needs no introduction. If your thinking of going just GO....LOL As always my reviews are based on experience and not just the food unless its terrible. Thank you!"
"447|2|Came here with my boss and wife one night after leaving work across the street at Citi. We came here because it was close and ""reasonably priced"". Do yourself a favor - keep on walking to whatever is next. Horrible service, cold food and waiting forever.Don't really need to say more except apparently at this restaurant, attitude is commonplace."
448|1|I was at Cheesecake Factory last week. We ordered a ribeye steak over medium it was good and juicy. Highly recommend this place for my friends!
"449|3|I've been to a few locations in the past but I decided to take my parents to the newly opened Newport location for brunch last Sunday. We were seated quickly and our server was prompt to take orders and have them out to us. We tried the crab hash, creme brûlée French toast, and monte cristo. All dishes were huge portions and true to form for Cheesecake Factory. The coffee was on the weak side so you're probably better off having your own from one of the places in the mall. All in all, a nice location with nice service. I would bring my parents back again."
450|2|I ordered the factory nachos which is my sons favorite. Since we dont have time to dine in i decided to order to take out. The packaging they did on the Factory Nachos was so dumb. They didnt put anything like a foil before they put the nachos inside the pizza box. They can use a better packaging.
451|3|Like one of the earlier reviewers said- This place does give the Cheesecake Factory a bad name.Agreed this is in a mall and does get crowded most of the time over the weekends but when it's not- I don't understand what the strategy is in putting your customers on a waitlist despite having plenty of empty tables.The portions are big enough just like at any other Cheesecake Factory.Thrice I have been here and all the three times they got us the molasses(brown) bread late with the meal.Considering that the neighborhood(unless you travel to grove st.) is devoid of good ambience restaurants I might come back.
"452|3|The food here was good. The chicken wings were really good. I felt the pasta was little dry.Talking about the service,it wasn't great. There was a little delay and waitress was not too attentive."
"453|2|Horrible experience trying to get a table at the place.With half the restaurant empty we allotted a corner table Asked for another one 3 tables down but we're told that there weren't enough staff 30secs later that table is given to another family The manager told us that was some miscommunication No apologies, the manager just walked back to her counter.No one caredIdk if this is straight up racist but never going to this place again"
454|2|Saw two of the employees smoking outside with their apron on. Atleast take it off when you're on your break. I hope they washed their hands before going back to work.
455|2|I don't know what the deal is with the CCF! Came here since it was located across from the hotel I was staying at thinking it was a safe bet for good food! Well food was mediocre and service was even worse! Hostess acted as we weren't standing there and I had to ask if we could get a table.....no such luck as we were forced to sit at high table in the bar area. I asked if it was okay that I had a minor in my party and I was surprised when they said yes it was fine....Our server acted as if we were bothering her by being there! She hardly checked on us and by the time it was time to pay we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for her to come and process the check! My husband literally walked around the restaurant trying to locate her so we could pay! I give 2 stars for the so/so food! Plain awful! Glad I was just visiting and don't have to subject myself to this craziness!
"456|2|Ordered take out.  Arrived and waited patiently before cashier acknowledged me.  Food was very oily, but most surprisingly there was human hair (seems like hair from below the waist) in my takeout.  I didn't bother going back because sometimes u don't know if the chef will do anything else to the food.  The 3 items I bought didn't look a bit appealing.  The only good part of the meal was the free bread."
457|2|It was the dirtiest restaurant that i've ever visited. we had to ask for changing our forks and knives but our server gave us more dirty one... i couldn't believe her service... it was awful... she was really unfriendly. no eyecontact. no concern about her customers. i can say this restaurant is the worst cheesecake factory in USA. What a shame.
"458|1|I had no idea this place was open until i saw it on the malls website. We came out on a saturday late afternoon and had only a 10 min wait for a party of 5 after being told 30 mins.... Not bad! Our waitress was efficient and personable and all of our food came out as ordered, hot, and on time. Waitress was very good on our refills both on drinks and bread :)Food as usual was good and cheesecakes yummy. Wish they would bring back the pineapple upside down cheesecake. Lol."
"459|3|The food is absolutely amazing and the portions are very large.  The Thai lettuce wraps and miso salmon are mouthwatering delicious.  Unfortunately, the service here is dreadfully slow.  We love going to all of the Cheesecake Factory's because we love the food and service is usually very good but at this particular location, something is just off.  I definitely recommend the Cheesecake Factory but not this particular location.  Of course if you love cheesecake, this place will certainly satisfy your cravings as there are about 50 available variations.  We try to eat healthy so we typically skip the dessert and also because the main course portions are so large that we are just too full to have dessert at that point."
"460|1|It's been a while since we went to Cheesecake Factory and we are thrilled!! This place is huge and the menu, wow, I think I need 30 minutes to fully digest what's on the menu!!! We were there around 3:30pm on a Saturday, and they serve lunch portion until 5pm. Scored!!! We ordered the fried mac and cheese appetizer (which was delicious!!!), chicken piccata (lunch portion for $12.95) and chicken and biscuit (full size). Wow that's a lot of food!!!!!!! Food was pretty good, service was great!! We skipped dessert but I know, I'll be back!!"
"461|1|We had no wait time since we came in on a Monday night around 9pm. We were greeted by the hostess and sat down right away. Our server James was awesome. He was very attentive and helpful. We ordered the smokehouse burger with sweet potato fries and I had the bow tie chicken pasta with a garlic sauce (I forgot what it's called). My bf said his burger was pretty good but wished he got more fries since all you get is about a cup full. My pasta was pretty good. It had really good flavors and  I really liked the tomatoes in it. My only thing is it had kind of a burnt aftertaste. Not sure if it was supposed to taste like that or it was the pancetta. Regardless I ate it and it was still good. Probably won't order that again though. James was great with keeping our cups full and answering any questions we had.CHEESECAKE TIME! We ordered two kinds, the red velvet cake and the white chocolate macadamia caramel cheesecake. My boyfriend liked them both. I was pretty meh about the red velvet but the caramel macadamia was soooooo good. Definetly a must try.  Didn't spend a fortune and we enjoyed a nice night out. Would be back again soon."
"462|1|I went there with my colleague and had chicken enchiladas. It was delicious. Nothing different though. Just like any other Mexican restaurant like Chillis. I wasn't a big fan of cheese cakes until I tried their red velvet cake Cheesecake. It was very yummy and moist. Next time, I do wanna try their Tiramisu cheesecake. They have so many different kinds of cheesecakes that I think one must differently try!!"
"463|2|Bartender made my drink wrong and was very short and made it apparent his break was top priority. Wings came out ICE cold, calamari was delicious! Wings came back saltier than i could handle, probably because they refried the already sauced cold wings. The bartender who took mr. Anxious off the shift was a sweetheart. Management need to be more present during lunch/happy hour rush."
464|1|Happy hour here is hard to beat. Good drinks and big apps that will leave you full. We came in hungry and had to box things up to take home. Loved the service. Gets busy but for good reason.
"465|1|Went here for dinner on a Saturday night. I made reservations in advance to avoid a waitlist and wanted a booth. I was called to be seated but I didn't want that table(wasn't a booth) and was told it was like a 15 minute wait which was no problem for me considering I arrived 30 mins early for my reservation. 15 minutes was more like 3 because I got seated right away. My rating is 5 stars because the food was amazing. Very tasty. Everything came out hot and within reasonable time. I can't remember my servers name but she was very nice and helpful. She had short hair I think her name started with an m. Everyone there was nice, even the bussers and food runners checking in on us to make sure everything was good. The only ""problem"" I had was with the hostess, she sped to the table, put the menus on the edge and then ran away. I understand though it was busy and I don't know what else they have to really do other than show us to a table so whatever, i guess it just seemed very rushed. I will be back soon however since I had a wonderful experience."
"466|2|I would give it zero stars if I couldThe service is not just Delaaayyyeeeed. - it's very baaaadThe salad portions [full sized portion ordered]  are extremely smallThe beer - unless you are seated at the bar - never arrivesIf you cancel the beer order - as it never arrived, and order a double shot of Glenlivet on the rocksIT ARRIVES NEAT [NO ICE] - IN A WINE BOWL [I ASSURE YOU IT WAS NOT A WHISKY GLASS]And the management is shameless enough to not rectify any of their service related issues - absolutely not apologeticAVOID THIS PLACE"
"467|2|Service is absolutely horrible. The waiter rushed us throughout the meal and relentlessly asked to clear our plates even though we were clearly still eating. Now we have our dessert, but we don't have any utensils and our dinner plates are still stacked on the table - and he is no where to be found. The food was fine but honestly the service here ruined the overall experience. I'm very disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory location. Definitely won't be back."
"468|1|Came in here with my mother in law.  It was first trip to this mall and this area and i must admit, i am NOT a fan of chain restaurants.  But, with the lack of parking in Jersey City these days, this was an easy option. Service was prompt and friendly.  The place was busy and humming.We each had a cocktail and the pineapple moscow mule was quite good!  I ordered the Nashville hot chicken app and while it really was nothing like the hot chicken in Nashville, it was good. We each had a salad, my MIL the chopped which was quite a generous portion and i had the seared tuna salad.  It was good, and not at all a large portion - just enough for lunch.  I will say that for the $19 price tag on this salad, it could have had more than 3 slices of the tuna but that would be my only complaint.  We were seated quickly, waited on promptly, with a waiter who was attentive and not distracting. If you are shopping in the mall, its an easy spot for lunch or dinner."
469|1|Idk why this cheesecake has low ratings. Everytime i go there they take good care of us .I enjoy the food and the atmosphere. The server was attentive and got our food out fast. My fav was the carne Asada and the choc tuxedo cheesecake!!!! And baby you can never go wrong with the Mac and cheese balls!  See ya soon!
"470|3|Service was extremely slow and I'm being polite. Also, it takes a lot of b**ls to charge this much for a drink(12.75 for a pineapple mojito). It would have been nice if the price was on the menu. This isn't NYC!food was ok, but now i have agita feeling like i was ripped off."
"471|3|Convenient place and has a lot of choices! The food and service are both good. For most of the nights and weekends this place is packed. However, I really have some problems with their dishes! There are A LOT water marks on the dishes every time which really annoyed me!"
472|1|This is by far THE BEST CHEESECAKE FACTORY IVE EVER BEEN TOO! The food was amazing! I mean finger licking good AMAZING! Not to mention our waitress was very nice! Extremely knowledgeable on the dishes and very courteous! We ordered so many things like the firecracker salmon and the mac & cheese balls that was my favorite! I will upload all the picture so you can see greatness for yourself! This location I will definitely recommend!
"473|1|With Cheesecake Factory, once you been to one, you know what to expect. The differencing factor is the wait time and service. According to Yelp current standing it is at a 3 star. Experience can change from time of day to server. Our luck, it seems to error on the later. We arrived before the Church crowd and baby wagons started to invade. We got a cheerful server Jennifer that was on point and just made our day. She was quick witted and just did everything right. I got my usual staple of Thai lettuce wrap as it is more than enough as a meal plus it is plenty healthy. Everyone else got their usual dishes, veggie burger, burgers and Wellness Salad. You can't finish off without having what the name of the place. We decided to try the Birthday Cake and Salted Caramel Cheesecake. Also our new favorite flavor!  Food quality is as you expect from the Chain restaurant, consistent. I'll have to say this was probably the best service and experience at a Cheesecake Factory to date. What better than to finish the morning with a casual stroll along the waterfront, baby Geese, and getting back to the other side of the river."
"474|3|I was really hungry for cheesecake this one day so i walked in and they were like hey. you can sit down at a table. it was really big for a cheesecake cafe. then they came out with what looked like Harry potter and the gobbo of fire, (you know.. the book) but when I opened it up.. it was... Chinese food, Mexican food, Pizza, Italian food, Hamburgers, Seafood, Southern food, sandwiches, Sushi, spagget. It was all the foods in the world! Super big menu! I forgot why i even was there in the first place there and i ended up getting a hamburger, but it took me an hour to order because i am not a fast reader so it took a while to get through the menu.I think its a good place if you have picky eaters because they have absolutely every food you could think of, they have very nice food presentation, and it kicks any TGIF type place in the butthole because its actually really good for this kinda style of restaurant.oh yeah I almost forgot. i got a hambuger with fried macaroni and cheese ball on it! It was kinda fun!"
475|1|Dynamite shrimp . Cant stop eating. Its delicious. Cant ask more good than this. Amazing food.
"476|2|The service in this establishment is beyond poor, as we sit here during happy hour when one would think they would want to turn tables, we have. Ow been sitting for 20 minutes and had to grab our own menus and still no server. But more to come."
477|1|Great food. Great enviorment. Worth the price. I had a rare stake. It was the one of the most tender stakes i had in along time. The crab bites were sweet and savory at the same time. You could taste the real crab. I recommend this for a good time. It really is a great addition to the newport mall.
"478|3|Is there anyway Cheesecake Factory would consider making smaller cheesecake slices? 1500-1700 calories for a slice of cheesecake is... disgusting. I think your customers would appreciate smaller portions which would reduce selling price. This is a prime example as to why America is so damn fat. Portions are ridiculous. If you're going to splurge on a cheesecake, I recommend the Celebration cheesecake which is basically a funfetti cake/cheesecake. I hate the fact that they got rid of my favorite salad, the luau salad, from back in the day. But their new menu is pretty good (at least the salads). I recommend the chicken, mango, avocado salad and the Sheila's chicken and avocado salad.I have never dined here but only have gotten take out a few times. Customer service was fine / sufficient."
"479|2|I wish I had an option of half a star.I am a big fan of cheesecake factory and that was the first time when I went out with my friends to this new location, we waited for 45 minutes and at the end the expereince was awful! I ordered Rigatoni Pasta, it was raw, extremely Al-Dente(So hard to chew) and had no taste.. Talked to manager had him changed to Four Cheese pasta for To-Go! When I got back they had packed Chicken Pasta for me.. I have been vegetarian whole of my life. This was the most disgusting experience everrrr...Not going back to this location and maybe not any of their franchises."
"480|3|It's the Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain. It's reliable and you know what to expect. I came here with my husband and two week old baby as we were walking past and there was ten minutes left of happy hour. Two drinks later and we were happy. The entire bar area is happy hour from 4-6pm so we ordered a beer and a cocktail which were both great. We also ordered a factory nachos which was $5.95 alongside many other happy hour apps. The plate that arrived was humongous! Seriously crazy sized - we didn't even finish it. Best value for $6 ever. So all in all, a great pit stop when we needed a seat and a chill out. It's not fine dining, and it's not crappy. It is what it is. Just don't take me there on an anniversary or special occasion!"
"481|1|Always like to go there. plates are gigantic and delicious. My favorite dish is shrimp jambalaya,  you should go and try"
"482|1|Other than the fact that the wait is pretty long, all is well. After trying out most of the cheesecakes on the menu, I feel like Godiva Cheesecake has become my personal favorite."
"483|1|I had Shrimp Scampi at this Cheescake location and it was amazing!!!! The service was also amazing, I highly recommend this location!"
484|3|Honestly last night was my first an last visit!! The place is beautiful but they need better seating arrangements for customers who are waiting for over an hour just to be seated. We waited outside because there was just too many people waiting to be seated. As we waited out side the restaurant too many teenagers where walking past I was wondering if I was going to have front row tickets to see a fight break out. Honestly I felt unsafe for the little girl I had with me and for my boyfriends safety because security wasn't doing there job!So after a hour and a half the buzzer finally rings we had sometime to look at the menu on our phone and knew what we wanted. I ordered  pasta Da Vinci it was awesome. My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon burger he loved it. And the little lady had the cheese pizza for kids and that was a thumbs up in her book!! The wait staff needs better training. We had to keep reminding the waitress to bring out our drinks more then three times and when she finally did of course we finished our sodas not a minute after we got them. And we had to keep reminding her to bring the kid size milkshake she needed to keep checking on. All in all the food was good. The wait was horrible and the waitress was below average I don't see myself visiting this Cheesecake Factory in the near future. I rather visit another location with more staff experience.
485|1|The roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread was yummy. Blueberry mojito very refreshing. And service is nice. Our hostess was super nice.
"486|3|The food is good but the service is terrible!I know this is a new spot thats why there is so many people. So when i went here, i got one of those buzzer things like to put you on a waiting list. the assistant said it would take 40 minutes. so we went and walked around the mall waiting for the buzzer to beat. around an hour later, still hasnt buzzed. so went back to cheesecake, my aunt complained why it hasnt buzzed, and the person said that they had paged the name on the list. ???they changed the buzzer and put us on the top of the list. 20 minutes later, they get us a table. we order food. food is great. but the waitress keeps coming back to us asking if the food is good as if she hasnt asked it the last 3 times already. we take the food as take out.overall, service to get a table is so crazy. it was only a table for 2 for us so wasnt a big of a deal. although if you are coming in big groups, i advice you to come 2 hours before you plan on eating here."
"487|1|First time trying the new Cheesecake Factory in JC. Great service and clean establishment. Serving are huge as they are known for. Food was well cooked and seasoned. Our waiter was great gave us the history of the restaurant, was nice to learn. I will definitely recommend this location and we will be back again. There was plenty for a hungry picky teenager to choose from, he was very satisfied. And my to go strawberry cheesecake was delicious."
"488|2|Came here for the first time on a Thursday night, the restaurant was busy but not packed. Our server was nice and friendly, but we waited 30 minutes for our entrees and the ""Garlic Noodles with Chicken"" came out to be very bland. I had to add lots of salt to make it somewhat more flavorful. The noodles were not garlicky at all! The Chicken and Biscuits came out okay but the biscuits were dry and hard.Very disappointed about the quality of food. Even though service was decent, but I would not come back. The food court in the mall would be better choices."
"489|1|Service was good and the food was great. Specifically, the Espresso martini was amazing! It was a bit confusing though when entering in from the mall entrance. I couldn't see the maitre'd station because it's back was to facing me when I came in. I guess it makes sense that they want to face the main entrance, but probably would be better to have it sideways."
490|2|Wait was surprisingly long but likely because of the holiday week. Staff are nice but slow and not good with busy hours. Had to ask for the bread which came out with entrees. Food was alright. Drinks were okay. Huge space though.
"491|1|Pros: Went with my family and we had a great time! Very clean and upscale. Our waitress was Erica and she was the best! You want a fun and outgoing person then choose her. Food was yummy and perfect temperature. Cons: The wait is a bit lengthy. When dinner came one of the plates were delayed for a few minutes. So while everyone was eating, one person from our party had to wait a little longer. (Erica did offer a soup on the house and apologized multiple times so that was nice) I think the chairs might not be tight enough because the table next to us complained that their chair was shaking due to one of us moving our legs. That was weird. Good location overall. I recommend."
492|1|1st day of opening and awesome service. The staff are sharp and attentive and the ambiance is to live for.
493|1|My experience was very nice! I came in and there was a short wait. The host was so sweet and found us a booth that was very comfortable. I got the pasta carbonara which was good and also my favorite toasted marshmallow cheesecake. Our server was nice and she was quick to bring us everything we needed. I was very happy !!
"494|1|Everything is yummy here I'm not kidding. They also provide skinny meals with a 590 or less calories. Still tasty! The only thing they need to improve is service. The longest waiting time I have ever experienced so far compared to other states cheesecake factory. Please hire more host and servers!! I waited outside for about 30mins that's fine, but I'm not comfortable with an another 60mins to get my food!"
"495|3|This lower review is strictly based on the waitress.. Tried to order a moscow mule (which consist of vodka, ginger beer and lime). They have their own version of the drink which also has pineapple.. I told her i wanted a regular mule no pineapple. I was unable to get it.. The reasoning made absolutely no sense. The attention we got was very subpar. I understand its the holidays, but when you come by my table to let me know the food is delayed and see that my water is empty. And walk away is not the standard im used to. That was after waiting 15min to have her stop by to see how we were doing. I order some water for my son because he finished his juice.. And this waitress took another 15 min. And its not like she is busy. I see her talking with co workers.. Its just horrible.Now for the food..THE AVOCADO Egg roll is amazing. Highly recommend it."
"496|1|It was our first time to come here and we were there on a Wednesday night. Although there was a queue, we were seated right away. We were surprised when we saw the serving; it was huge. The menu has a wide selection. Their cheesecakes are really delicious."
"497|1|Made my way over to the Cheesecake Factory for their opening on December 8th. The wait time was about on par with any other location, about twenty minutes. Once we were seated, our server was nice but definitely very inexperienced. He had to continually go ask other employees questions that he didn't know the answer to, which while a little more time consuming, is preferable to him making up an answer or not even bothering. Overall, however, everyone was very helpful and attentive. In terms of food, I got my staples, which are the Buffalo Blasts for appetizer and the Cajun Chicken Littles for an entree. I think it's great that a Cheesecake Factory opened up in the Newport Mall, it definitely spruces the place up a bit."
498|1|I love the cheese cake factory so when I saw they were opening one up at newport mall I had to come. First we had to wait 54 mins for a table the place was packed.  Once we sat down i order a Pina colada to drink once it came it was really watery I sent it back and they made me a better one. The food was delicious and our waiter steven was very nice. I am giving this location a 4 out 5 because of the watery drink and the fact they seemed a bit disorganized service was not fast at all. They just opened so hopefully they will get better because the food is outstanding.
"499|1|My wife and I came here Christmas eve. and the place was packed! We were excited that a new place opened so we tried it and glad we did. It was about a 40 min wait as we expected since its new and on a holiday night but didn't mind.Service:The waiter...Tyquan...was extremely friendly and got down low enough so we were all face to face. He answered our questions and ordered our meal. He served us well, asked how everything was going 15 minutes after we started and the two of us were pleased. 5 stars hereMeals:I ordered their Louisiana chicken, My wife got the Thai glazed salmon . The taste was great !!!  The amount of pasta they gave me was in abundance compared to other places and it was spicy! My wife loved her Salmon and the two of us could""nt  finish. The serving size is huge. 5 starsSetting inside :Dimmed lights, very cozy and unique shape. There is outside seating if you wish. I highly recommend this place if you don't mind the wait. After all, if this place was bad, there wouldn't be so many people inside. That tells you something.Cheesecake:How many varieties do you like? there are so many that you can try a different type each day and you will be done with the menu in 3-4 weeks. The taste is great ."
"500|1|So I'm going to give this place a 4-star mostly because the nachos were awesome (perhaps somewhat surprisingly to me... Could've been low expectations sure. But they were tasty!). After being trapped inside due to snowmageddon, my lady and I came to the mall to relieve some cabin fever. Mostly an empty mall. But Cheesecake Factory was open and we got thirsty. The bar is first come first serve and no seats. Despite seeing many a table open the hostess advised is was a 30 minute wait. We decided to put our name in and grab a drink. Luckily we were able to sit and just order from the bar so we never had to wait. Drinks (margarita and some Mai tai's) were pretty good. As I said the nachos were delicious. Service was slow. But could be because they were not expecting much with the storm? I don't know.... They had a tv to see the game if you wanted. I guess it's a Cheesecake Factory and when you are at the mall it suffices. But get the nachos. And another tip: out your name Down and go shopping. They willing give you a beeper (antiquated technology but still does the job)"
501|2|I wish I could give them a zero star because that place is a joke. I ordered the almond encrusted salad and it was the worse thing ever. How hard is it to make a salad and add salmon to it. So grotesque
"502|2|I typically love Cheesecake Factory. But this location: service was cold and standoffish. No bread or water offered. Hey, maybe he was having a bad day, I don't know. But the food was equally unsatisfying. I got a Cobb salad which came with maybe 3 heads of chopped romaine lettuce and a sliver of chicken. A SLIVER lol I've had chicken nuggets bigger than the chicken provided in this salad. I was hungry after my one sliver of chicken so finally asked for bread. The end :)"
503|1|This is new to Jersey City so everyone wants to come and try out the food so don't be surprised if it's packed when you come inside. They opened December 8th so it's always busy when you come in. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating. The servers were so polite and attentive to my table. The managers are very friendly. I definitely recommend you coming in and trying out the food and cheesecake despite the really long wait. It is definitely worth it despite what others say. You should definitely try it out and have a taste for your self!!! I recommend the steak diane and the Godiva cheesecake for sure! P.S. Come around 2-3ish pm. That's when people from work start to leave to go back to work. There shouldn't be a wait by then.
"504|2|This was our first time at this specific location and the WORST service we have ever received at this franchise. We waited at least 5-10 minutes before a server came over to our table. We didn't receive bread until I asked for it and the waitress said ""I am going to see if it's ready now"". The taste of the food is never an issue. We ordered buffalo blasts for an appetizer and didn't receive the wing sauce which always comes as a condiment to the meal. When I asked for the sauce, she never brought it over. She brought over bleu cheese instead. About 3 minutes after the appetizer was provided, our entrees came out. So we were eating, the bread, appetizers, and entrees at one time. Then, my husband and cousin has empty drinks and she didn't ask to refill the glasses. We are beyond disappointed at this service and will not be returning to this location. The waitress clearly could care less about the customers and seemed disinterested. Going forward, we will stick to the Menlo Cheesecake factory."
"505|1|This is my first time coming to this Cheesecake Factory. I was not greeted at the door but I'm guessing that's due to the fact that it is in a mall. The hostess who placed me on the wait list never looked up at me, she simple asked named and party size ( that could've been better). That aside , my wait time was not bad , the staff was very friendly . My waitress Mellissa was AMAZING. She was attentive , friendly , efficient and warm.  I  ordered the crab bItes and parmesan crusted chicken . Both were tasty and hot when they arrived at the table . I would definitely come back.Great Job"
"506|1|Ok this is my new favorite spot.  I live in the area and I've come here atleast 3 times, and plan on going back.  If you come at their busiest time, there will be a wait, but I've come before 4 and haven't had to wait.   My favorite dish is the Hibachi Steak, and I'm in love with avocado egg rolls and Cuban egg rolls.  I've had eggplant parmesan and it was huge portions.  The lettuce wraps are a fun appetizer.   The Typhoon punch and the Tropical Martini were good. The cheesecakes are delicious, I've had the salted caramel and the tiramisu cheesecake. I plan on going back, there's so much to try. The food is delicious."
507|2|This is probably the worst experience we have！ We waited for more than 1 hour for the meal. Food is good，but I won't waste my time here again！
"508|2|Terrible, never going back! Service was so slow, staff did not seem to care at all, from the greeter to the waitress, awful service, very unprofessional staff. Food was disappointing as well, ordered medium rear rib eye which came out burnt as a charcoal. Wife's pasta came out cold. Only good thing was daughters quesadilla. Wait on food was extremely long. Took about 2.5 hrs for 3 courses! We came here for my sons 20 birthday, it was such a terrible and disappointing experience, we specifically chose this ""new"" location hoping for a good meal and at least satisfactory service but received neither. Will probably never go back to any Cheesecake Factory again, there are plenty restaurants with much better quality food and service for the price. At least the food looked OK (but didn't taste OK!)"
"509|2|I love cheesecake factory.  This is a fake one.  The food is not the same.  Ive been to at least 4 other locations in nj and fl, over a dozen times, and this was by far the worst.  Service was ok, the food just sucked compared to the others.  What was unfortunate was we brought other people that had never eaten here, set high expectations, and we were all diapointed.  No more."
510|3|Get ready to spend 1-2 hours before you get food on your table. Although food is good here but service is pathetic. Nobody will come to check if food is delayed. I waited more than 40 mins before we complained and then manager of the restaurant got us our order. No doubt food is good but come prepared to wait especially on weekends.
"511|1|Great new addition to jersey city.  Welcome Cheesecake Factory.  I love the skinnylicious menu. What a great location to have this restaurant. Just opened a couple of weeks ago, no reservations yet.Staffs are friendly and the food is fresh."
512|2|WORST Cheesecake Factory location on the East Coast!!!! I ordered a Caesar Salad with chicken....how in the world do you mess that up....I don't think they even gave me Caesar tasted like an old ranch type dressing. I was so disappointed it ruined my evening not to mention I left the whole salad and was still hungry afterwards.
513|2|What they call a margherita pizza is with grated Parmesan instead of mozzarella. Sad.
"514|2|So we decided to come here on a Saturday evening on and try this place because it was a new place for us. We had never been there and everybody talks about it , what looks to be a promising place with a dark bar like atmosphere seem to have good promise but we were extremely disappointed by the food. The service was OK , the waitress was very busy to check up on her table every so often. We did order some food,  two of my guests had burgers which came out terrible. They had to be returned and still came out wrong. No seasoning and did not know what medium term was. I had some steak dish which was just ok. Took two pieces of overpriced cheesecake home which one was good and the other had to go to the trash. I do not recommend this place to anybody especially for the price you will pay you're better off going to a burger  place maybe even the one next to them. Don't believe the hype!"
"515|2|Ever walk out of a restaurant because no one ever brought you anything? Yup...that happened. If you enjoy being frustrated, this is your spot. I love the Cheesecake Factory...every location apparently but this one."
516|1|The food here is really good but the timing is hot or miss- i ordered chicken parm (pizza style) i really liked my entree and i would order it again.
"517|2|Subpar food and a poor excuse for creole food. I ordered the jambalaya pasta and was underwhelmed, especially with the fact that the shrimp were not deveined and properly cleaned. I asked the waitress and she said ""that's not something we do here...."" okay? So properly cleaning the food you prepare isn't something you do? Okay. Besides the desserts, I don't see a point in this restaurant."
"518|1|Let's start off with the waiter . Antonella S, how can I put this nicely ? She was a horrible waiter. She seemed very nice, smiled and Took our order. Then I barely saw her. I was with two kids and my boyfriend. After the kids food came she got lost. She never brought me the water I asked for, for the whole table. She never came to bring us bread. She didn't bring me the drink I ordered which was a smoothie. She comes back in what seemed like forever to me and I then had to ask her for bread because she didn't seem like she was ever going to bring it and I felt like I was starving to death. Still didn't bring me my water or my drink. Didn't come back to check if the kids food was okay or if they needed anything. The kids are almost done with their food and she STILL didn't come back with my water or bread or anything. By this point I was BEYOND frustrated and starving half to death. Another waiter by the name Yoval not sure his position but must of noticed the frustration in my face because he randomly came up to us and asked if we would want some bread. He was awesome compared to my waiter who lacked bunch of waiter skills. Then she came with my drink after she saw him helping us. Not sure if she had too many tables or if she just kept forgetting about us because she didn't even apologize the times she did happen to come back. He also came around to see if we needed refills on our drinks. She came and gave us the dessert menu and then never came back. The same gentleman kept looking at us and eventually came to see what we wanted to order. Im not going to let one sour apple ruin the tree so my waiter may have been horrible at customer service but the food was BEYONDDDDDDDD GOOD. I had the hibachi steak with mashx2 And some fried shrimp on top and it was to die for. I don't think I even stoped to breath lol my boyfriend had the chicken with steak combo with mash and Mac and cheese on the side . Which was also very good . Ultimately this place has GREAT food they probably should just coach that specific waiter on paying attention to her tables. World of advice If your going to disappear please make sure they table is good before doing so. Thank you YIVAL for acknowledging me and my family !"
"519|2|DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR CREDIT CARD STOLEN. I left my card here after paying the bill and went back the next day to get it. Shortly after, random charges start popping up on my account even though I had the card. Someone working there clearly made a copy of my card. I further called the manager and asked him to investigate. then he never followed up or returned my call. Very sketch, avoid."
520|3|Went for a birthday party and not a pleasant experience. Waitress will keep forgetting what we asked. They did not even serve plates even after we got our appetizer. Waitress was trying to do her job and pretending she is servicing us. Food was ok. Cheesecake were awesome and 3 stars for that purpose only.
"521|3|I'm here as I write this. Food is good BUT this chick at the take out register is rude!! She doesn't have a name tag on but she does have on a gold name necklace, she's probably Latino or Caucasian. But she slid me my debit card when I placed it in her hand... blew spit bubbles because I wasn't sure of what I wanted. Horrible."
"522|2|Me and my husband visit this location twice a month or so, and we usually like the service & the food despite its small number of vegan options. But yesterday neither the service nor the food was OK. As a matter of fact both of us were up all night, my husband throwing up and myself with a big heartburn/masslike feeling in my stomach. We both ate impossible burger, he also got some fries, I got the salad. Actually we both felt uncomfortable in the stomach right after. The waitress was either overworked or not attentive -I.e. the small serving plate was not clean, my husband want it to get changed - the new one never came. I did not have any forks, but a knife, my husband had two forks and no knife. The waitress did not ask how we are doing, nor checked the water. This place was better when it was even more crowded - it's less since Zinburger opened right across. This was 8 PM'ish so was not the worst busy time either. Something definitely changed here - can't tell exactly what"
"523|2|I frequent many Cheesecake Factory all around but I've never had service as bad as this one. The food wasn't too bad, a little colder than the usual but nothing worth complaining about.Now let's get to the service. I arrived and the hostess was on her phone, no big deal since she turns around and seats me right away. Next I get seated with my party of four, and we look at the menu for about 5 minutes and are ready to order.5 minutes past nobody even came to take our drinks. Another 10 minutes went by and still no one to even ask for drinks. Raise my hand up to call for a server but another 10 minutes nobody. With probably 10 servers running back and forth, after 30 minutes my server walks up casually and has the audacity to ask if we had the chance to decide what we want to drink!!!After ordering and getting out drinks I'm seeing others that ordered after us started getting their food already. It was 24 more minutes before we all got our food. My family literally spent almost 2 hours waiting!!!"
"524|2|I love Cheesecake Factory but this location is the most disappointing one ever. It's close to my Apt so I've been here more than 5-6 times and each time the service has been bad. I didn't get their usual bread first two times so I started asking for it and to my disbelief I didn't get it on any of my visits !! Once I even asked my server where was my bread and he kept saying it's coming ! The servers are very inattentive, they'll takes ages to get to you after they've taken your order. No water refills, we had to chase our server for the check ! Seriously disappointed! I hope the management fixes the situation at this location ! I love their food and would have loved it if my experience here was better !!!!"
"525|2|We were told we would have a 20 minute wait, which was fine since one usually expects a wait on a weekend afternoon. Once we were seated, the people in the booth behind us were in an argument with their server, who was yelling back at them - so the server was replaced with another who now seemed to have to cover a bigger area.There were 5 of us...we put in our drink order - sodas and lemonades and while the sodas arrived quickly, we waited another 5 minutes for the lemonades. The food seemed to be slow coming out, the appetizers about 30 minutes after we ordered, one which was the wrong item and corrected quickly and the entrees, another 30 minutes later, with 2 of the 5 delayed another few minutes.All in all, we spent over 2 hours when it should have only been 1. While the server was pleasant, I feel that the pace needs to be picked up a bit. I won't say that I will never visit another CF, but I doubt that I will revisit the Jersey City location."
"526|1|Amazing experience here from the apps to the cheesecake. My friend got the chicken bellagio which was phenomenal, as were the cheese bites and the burger. Our server, James, was phenomenal! We will def be returning."
"527|2|This place is a joke. The fact that several patrons complain of inattentive servers obviously points to an ongoing issue that's never been adequately addressed by management. I've visited this location twice this past month, and I've come to notice that you either get service that's 50% attentive or none at all (Note to Cheesecake-gotta aim for that 100%). For example, during today's visit I ordered a New York steak well done and what I got was medium with lots of pink. Sent it back and noticed that only the side that I had cut was browned while the rest was still pink-maybe the cook thought I was color blind. Ended up just taking it to go because I was full from the appetizer round and figured I'd cook it again at home. Honestly, don't plan on dining here again-save myself the trouble and spend my money elsewhere."
"528|3|I like to try all kinds of different establishments, I went to The Cheesecake Factory in Florida one year and it was amazing. When I saw one open at the Newport Mall I was so open to try it, got there and totally forgot about the waiting lines. Wow its like a club with groups of people waiting with their buzzers to get in. Hilarious but was lucky to only wait 15 min. So I originally went to get dessert but when they hit you with the big menu I couldnt say no. Surprisingly the food was ok but got so stuffed that my dessert came short lol. Cool spot and def the local date spot on the weekends for some but other than the long wait not bad. Next time ordering dessert first."
"529|1|Although the Cheesecake Factory is just another American chain restaurant I believe it deserves a 4 star just because I do think that it is the upper echelon of American chain restaurants.              First off, this is the first place I got to try the pumpernickel bread. I immediately fell in love. The portion of the entrees is overwhelming and although you'll be packing on the calories, you get your monies worth and a doggy bag to go. The menu is extremely extensive with so many options from Asian cuisine to Italian to Mexican. I almost always get the spicy chipotle chicken sandwich with a side of fries which never ever disappoints. The shrimp scampi is pretty good as well. I recently had the herb crusted salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus and it was so good. Finish off the meal with one of their amazing cheesecake and you'll be a satisfied customer. Don't forget to get the strawberry lemonade too.      There's usually a little wait every time I come here but the high tops and bars are a little more accessible. Our servers have always been efficient and nice. I enjoy this place when I'm in the mood to feel gluttonous."
530|2|Firstly I love CF but today we had the worst experience at this location. Usually they accommodate us always. We requested a table which had reg chairs instead of the booth with leather couches because I had a back issue so couldn't sit on the leather couch. Plus we asked for a high chair. This was clearly explained to the manager at the front desk.after making us wait for 20 min they still give us the wrong table. When we requested a reg chair they denied us. They could not accommodate us at all anywhere in the entire restaurant and we had  to leave. They did not even consider accommodating. Not to mention the crying baby. Really bad CF!!!! Really bad service!!!!
"531|2|I have always maintained that Cheesecake Factory was one of the only ""dine in "" chains I didn't mind eating at .  The service here was atrocious.  Our waiter was great but the hostess and hostess station is a mess.  Lots of eye rolling, snarky comments, and butting in to customer conversations there.  I don't often leave bad reviews, BUT when you walk in there is a sign directing you to go see the hostess.... She shouldn't ignore you for 10 minutes while you stand in front of the booth.  CHEESECAKE factory I would be happy to tell you exactly when I was there.... I certainly won't be back ."
532|1|I worked at cheesecake factory for several years in college. I can say first hand from seeing the behind the scenes at several restaurants that the cheesecake factory is top quality. The restaurant has very high standards for the quality of their food and service. The food is all prepared fresh daily along with fresh fish. The sauces are prepared to order. The dressings are made from scratch. It is all delicious. My favorite thing is the variety. There are over 250 items on the menu including skinilicious items and vegatarian items.Do not be turned off by the wait- there is a reason for it. The food is great and they try their best to not send food to the table that is not up to their standards. I've personally seen a manager try a sauce for a dish and make the kitchen remake the whole thing. The manager chose to make the guest wait for a quality product and even bought them dessert after explaining why they were making them wait.Just a note... don't order brown bread or pumpernickel...it's whole wheat!
"533|2|My sister came to visit from Florida and we were in the Newport Mall to see a movie. We then decided to eat at this location in the mall even though I'm not a big fan of how big theIr menu is. I know it sounds weird but it's almost like they have TOO many options, but to appease my sister we went for it. We were a party of three and seated fairly quickly. The place looked like it was dying down around 9:45pm. We sat for about 5 minutes before a waitress came over and she took our drink order and brought over warm bread. She seemed nice enough and said she'd be back with our drinks in a few minutes. At this point, I took a deep breath and began to examine the menu. It took me almost 10-15 minutes to finally make a decision on my meal but low and behold we hadn't even gotten our drinks yet. My sister and my son had already picked out their meals and were looking around for the waitress. After an additional 5 minutes, she came with our drinks and then we ordered right away. I ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken, my son; the ribeye steak, and my sister order lettuce chicken wraps and edamame. So we're sipping our drinks and eating bread, conversing and enjoying our time together when I realize that we still haven't gotten our food. The time? 10:50pm. I looked around and there wasn't a trace of our server. I asked a hostess walking by if she could find our server as our food was taking long. She seemed disinterested and said she'd find our server. 2 minutes later wouldn't you know it? The hot food finally comes out, minus my sisters lettuce wraps and edamame. Well, we wait like 5 more minutes and her meal comes out. It's important to note that we STILL have not seen our server since she took our order. So I take a bite and I have to admit its pretty good, not the best meal ever but decent. Finally the sever came by and at this point we were just glad we got our food so we asked for refills and continued our meal. Then, it happened. My sister took a bite of one of the wraps and immediately spit out the chicken cause she said it tasted strange. She bit into the chicken and we saw it; the chicken was COMPLETELY raw. And what's worse is that she had eaten most of it already. At this point, we proceeded to wait another 10 minutes to grab someone, anyone's attention. I managed to flag down the same hostess and ask for a manager. Another 10 minutes and a manager shows up. I explain the current situation and the long wait time and the absence of our server and she simply said she'd take the wraps off the bill and was sorry. The server then shows up and apologized and offered dessert. We ordered a dulce de leche cheesecake to go just cause we wanted to get the hell out of there. She brought the cheesecake and the check after another 10 minutes and when I opened the check, I was appalled. The manager comped the lettuce wraps but the charge for the cheesecake was on the bill. I mean, come on? Really? Your server offered dessert and you couldn't even comp the dessert or even the drinks??? Where is the customer service?? I was so pissed at that point. I just paid and left a 15% tip which I never do cause I worked in a restaurant for over a decade and I ALWAYS take care of my fellow servers. I know it's not an easy job and you gotta put up with a lot of BS but I also know that it is managements job to get it right and I feel very strongly that this location dropped the ball. In total, we spent almost an hour and a half in that place. And about 15 minutes of that was spent actually eating. I will never, never, ever return to a Cheesecake Factory again."
"534|1|Normally don't do these chain restaurants as the food is usually nasty and bland, went there on a Wednesday evening so the place was not that packed, Hostess was very pleasant, My wife got the fish tacos which the tacos were basic but everything else that filled it was great & tasted really fresh& I got some kind of Parmesan Chicken with pesto & Couscous, which was really great, a tad bit too much oil but was still great. We split a slice of pumpkin cheesecake, which was really really great & we were tempted to get another slice. Great food, great atmosphere, great service & price was not bad. Will definitely be going back. Not many of these types of chain restaurants in Jersey City & none as good as Cheesecake factory."
535|2|I generally enjoy The Cheesecake Factory and have on occasion gone to the ones in PARAMUS and such. I am super happy to have it here in Jersey City YET the staff continues to not step up. They are nice. Yes. But inexperienced. Frequently bringing food to the wrong table. We waited over 25 minutes for cheesecake (already made) to be brought to the table. Our waitress (super nice) forgot things multiple times - after multiple reminders - like a straw. Honestly there are so so many staff and waiters / waitresses and it feels aimless and unfocused. Is it management?  Is it inexperienced servers?  All I know is I won't be coming here often.  Sorry :( I wanted to love ya.
"536|2|I really Thank the waitress Ashly she was great and wonderful and deserve a 5 star!The reason why I gave 2 stars for this Cheesecake Factory branch is that when me and my family woke up . Me and my mother where vomiting and we are having upset stomach now. Since we where 5 in total eat and all the other 3 where fine. The only food me and my mother had in common that the rest didn't have was that small ""mayo-like /egg-like thing"" they put in a small plastic coin dollar size plastic. !!I have eat many times in cheese cake factory but this is my worst ""food experience"". Do not mix with waitress as she was keen and full of energy .I feel so terrible right now !!!"
537|2|The slowest most uncoordinated restaurant ever. Don't waste your time because the staff at this cheese cake factory certainly pales in comparison to the location in NY.
"538|2|Worst Experience ever! What an embarrassment to my guests.  I made a reservation for 7 about 2 weeks ago, received  a conformation call about 4 days prior to us going.   On the day of... I called in to change the reservation to 6:30 from 6pm and  was told I was not in the book!. Explained I got a conformation call  how could i not be in the book...I was like ok, I  can let this pass..as long as they could seat myself and my guests. We get there and were seated in a booth clearly made for 4 people to be comfortable..we all squeezed in  and had one person sit with a chair at the end of the table.  The place wasn't super busy, I would of thought we have a comfortable place in the back ..but we dealt with it.  We ordered drinks and appetizers..appetizers came out  right away..the drinks about 20 minutes after. Then our waitress disappeared for over 10 minutes and we wanted to place our dinner orders. I had to flag another waitress to find her.  We were done with the appetizers and drinks and no one came back to the table to see if we wanted refills or more appetizers. Fast forward 45 minutes later...finally our dinner plates started showing up at the table 2 at a time. 1 person had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the Chicken & biscuits meal. At this point everyone was clearly aggravated. The manager came to our table once just to hand us our drinks from the bar..When we requested him to come to the table again he sent someone else. Long story short. 3 people had to send their dinner plates back, we barely saw our waitress  and the manager cowardly hid from us. What a way to ruin a Friday night celebration dinner."
539|2|Had been there yesterday.. Even though I liked the ambiance of the place food  wasn't so appealing... Order Buffalo wings which tasted average have had better ones...n a Salmon appetizer which I felt had a. Little raw taste...main course followed the chipotle sauce paste which was assured to be spicy bt  ended up being sweet and disappointing.... The main course Salmon dish with rice was reasonably good and then orderer the truffle pastry which was again a decent option....bt having gone for a birthday treat was not really satisfied :( :(
"540|2|This place has a lot of kinks to work out. I'm going to blame it on the fact that it's still new. They told me the wait was 70 mins which was ok cuz I had to shop so came back about 45 mins later and was next so that wasn't too bad. Service was lacking major!! Ordered kale salad, they forgot the apples and green beans that go in there. I finished my salad app before we even got our drinks, water & lemonade. Shrimp angel hair pasta, shrimp was way over cooked, tough  My dish orange chicken, mash was cold, veggies way over cooked. Oh and we had to ask for bread, even after my appetizer. Smh!! Hackensack is so much better!!!!"
"541|3|I love Cheesecake Factory, especially their herb crusted salmon. However the hostess with the reddish brown hair with the nose piercing was rude, she saw me coming and just left"
542|1|As everyone says long waiting time but I would say it's worth the wait. Good place to go with the kids too and loads of vegetarian options.
"543|2|The management staff are young, this place need to change the unorganized management staff."
544|1|Food was AMAZING...  service was cool. Drinks took forever to come. I had to check at the bar twice because my waiter took forever.  My fiance's drink was weak ( typhoon). I returned it.
545|1|Ordered 6 inch original cheesecake for my birthday. It's far more a good deal than buying as slices. You pay extra 3 dollar to write birthday words on a chocolate plate.
"546|2|I have checked into the Cheesecake Factory located within the Newport Mall, the customer service so far is subpar. We waited 5-6 minutes by the hightop tables before having to ask someone to clean, we were never offered bread, the servers were not knowledgeable of today's menu, and were presented with extreme slow aloof customer service. Our neighbors were offered their meals with no utensils and all patrons cannot help but get the feeling that ""we"" coming across as bothersome to the staff. Lastly but not least, my friend was given ice tea with little to no ice. #customerservicemuch?"
"547|2|The utensils they gave has still has sauce and rice. So gross!!!!!!      The manager apologized and said she will come back to check on us, but never came back.  Eeeeewwwww!!!!!"
"548|2|Slow, lots of servers running around. I realize it's busy, but it's been open for too long since the start to have this type of service.  Appetizers and entrees out at the same time?  An hour for others at the table to get food.  This place needs a serious management overhaul.  We're here for the cheesecake, but this may be the last time we give it a chance."
"549|2|Went in for dinner with my boyfriend tonight (Friday night), it was busy and we were quoted a wait time of thirty minutes which was accurate. Our server Omar came over promptly and we were able to give him our whole order upon his greeting. A chicken sandwich, cheeseburger spring rolls and a cup of soup.... we waited forty five minutes, watching tables around us get their food before Omar addressed the issue. I can tell he was overwhelmed, and probably would have given good service otherwise, but we still waited a full hour before our food arrived. First my soup, which was cold and needed to be reheated, then my boyfriends sandwich, and lastly my rolls, all delivered separately. By the time all the food had arrived we were visibly upset. Omar apologized, but we were never offered any compensation for our ordeal, and worse off the ridiculous wait was never addressed by a manager, in fact we didn't see a manager on the floor at all tonight. We left feeling extremely neglected and would not have spent our money here if we knew this would be how we were treated."
550|2|This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have eaten . The guys who served us treated very bad . So I left him 1$ dollar tip . He was not even worth that . And he yelled in front of everyone that we left him a dollar.  Worst food and highly racist environment.
"551|1|Emanuel at the cashier desk was awesome--super friendly and very helpful, went out of his way to accommodate. Five stars for service based on him. Food seems to have gone down in quality over the years. Salads used to be chock full of stuff--Santa Fe had a lot of corn and beans, chopped tomatoes. Now it's got a couple wedges of tomatoes, and it's pretty chintzy on the corn, beans, and chicken. A pity. Three stars for that."
552|2|First time me and my husband got food from here and it made us sick to the stomach. Unacceptable
553|1|Went there on the first day of opening so everything was shining brand new. Workers w. huge smiles their faces must have been hurting lol. Best thing I had on all visits was the cheesecake (one was carrot) n the fried Mac n cheese balls I live for these but pretty sure it's artery clogging otherwise  would eat them every other day .  When very busy wait for take out can be nerve wrecking even for cheesecake which located AT the take out counter.
554|1|Love this place. love the atmosphere and the food is amazing. Place is very clean and the desserts are out of this world. The waitress was very knowledgeable. I had the tacos which for amazing. Finding parking is hard but if you're already in the mall you have full access to them.
"555|1|Omg I'm so happy to have The cheesecake factory so close to me...love the food, the ambience and the customer service. Best appetizer ever are the mac and cheese fried balls... must have. The one thing I wish they would do its simplify the menu... it has soooo much and it's kind of overwhelming, that I often skip looking at it and go for the same dish. But the staff is super and the food delish. And now I have a new personal fav when it come to the cheesecake... tiramisu cheesecake... ummm the best of both world."
556|2|Very disappointed tonight could they be out of anything else and still be open for business!!!  A word of advice just list what your out of it should not take 30 minutes to find out what's available.  Just close if you can't provide services.  Bad management did not try to make things right.  Sorry just AWFUL!!!!!!!
"557|3|Wait time was 45 mins, but it was a Saturday evening, so expected.  It's hard to give it a 4 or 5 rating, it's really just a chain restaurant with dim lighting, and crowded seating.  They herd you in, they herd you out.  The food was very good though, I liked the Hibachi Steak, $20.50 was a little steep.  And the service was prompt and with a smile.  Still, if you're going to order overpriced food, you may as well take the Path across the river and get actual good chefs to make something great instead of typical stuff like Cheesecake sells.  No offense if you like the place tho!"
558|1|I received a $30 gift card from Cheesecake factory.... They were extremely apologetic
559|2|Not happy this location sucks I waited 20 minutes for cheesecake my bread came out the same time as my entree when I called the manager he brought the cheesecakes right away but I shouldn't have had to do that. The employees are overworked and are given too many tables. This is the closest cheesecake to me but won't be coming back
"560|2|This is probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. I usually enjoy the food and get good service at other locations, but it seems like this one can't seem to figure out how to do that. My visit to this location was on 1/14 at around 7:30- the wait was 30 minutes which was fine, however the bathrooms were disgusting. I told the hostess this and asked if she could get anyone to clean them, and she said ""no, we do that at the end of the night"". Well, okay, I guess the only guests that get clean bathrooms are the ones that go as soon as they open? I let it go as we were being seated, our server was awful. We asked for the bread that is normally brought out when you get seated three times, and finally got it with our appetizers. We were unable to get refills on our drinks in a timely manner, it doesn't seem that hard but I guess that would have been too much for our server. Every part of the meal came out burnt, but because we had to wait so long to order our appetizers we ate them anyway. We had the fried macaroni and cheese and the Factory nachos- the Factory nachos we did not eat, the chips were black. So we order our entrees, three of the same burger- they all came out burnt, they were completely black- not the way meat should look. I try a bite of mine, end up not being able to eat it, one is untouched and the third was half eaten because our server couldn't do her job and we were starving because we waited so long to order each time. 20 minutes pass as we are awkwardly sitting there waiting for our server to ask how the food is, so we can tell her there is an obvious issue. She finally comes and we ask for the manager, the manager comes and I explain the problem with our food. Normally management should respond positively, but unfortunately my valid complaints were just met with argument from this man. As I told him the nachos were burnt and clearly were mostly untouched, he says ""no we just like to give them more crisp, they aren't burnt"". So I pick up one of the many black chips and show it to him, where he finally agreed they were burnt. As for the burgers, we said we did not want them as we had to wait 20 minutes to even let anyone know there was a problem- the manager insists we should get new ones instead of getting them off the check because he doesn't understand why we would wait so long- but finally acquiesces to take two burgers off our check. Though we still had to pay for the uneaten, burnt nachos. Maybe if the service wasn't awful we would have been able to fix the many problems we had with our meal, but unfortunately the restaurant is not clean, the food is not good and management seems unable to fix guests issues."
561|2|Best pasta in town? What a joke. The pasta is so hard my stomach hurts.
"562|2|Although I like Cheesecake Factory, this location is 1 star for their service, host and the manager. Had a group of people for lunch, we were told we would be sited in 30 minutes - end up waiting an hour. Asked to talk to a manager, manager never showed up."
563|2|The worst phone service I've seen. Tried to make a reservation - left on hold for over 10 minutes. Finally hung up and called back. Suddenly I'm told they don't take reservations at this time and nobody remembers anything about anyone being left on hold. Ridiculous.
564|1|Loved it. Food exceeded expectations. Maybe the lettuce in the Asian lettuce chicken wrap should be bigger to avoid getting messy. 20 min of waiting time at dinner to get seated.
"565|2|Waited for 30 mins and nobody stopped by to take the order. Interesting, what's the waiting time when the place is full... Anyway left without trying the food, nobody even noticed. Time wasting. Disappointing."
"566|1|Great food, great service, great atmosphere. The ideal spot for a date in the mall or just celebrating any other holiday. The service was great and attentive and the food was warm, fresh, and delivered at a timely matter. I couldn't think of a better place to eat at in Newport Mall."
"567|1|So good! Our server was great, in a party of 4 every single appetizer, dish and cheescake we ordered were delicious."
568|2|Overpriced decent food. My dad was unhappy with the service. Overall it's ok but nothing memorable
569|1|Its a great place to eat monday-thursday but this is place is a nightmare friday-sunday
570|1|I enjoyed my visit here. This location is very busy but food is great and excellent customer service. Be prepared for a wait time.
"571|1|Funny things, I don't like cheesecake, I usually order the carrot cake! Yummy! And my favorite, shrimp scampi! EXTRA large shrimp! I forgot what drink I ordered, I believe it was a mojito, but it was delish!!"
"572|3|The food was usual Cheesecake Factory fare, which is always too much food and rich in caloric content. However, the service here was just atrocious! It took forever to get waited on, forever to get our drinks, and forever to get our dinner. The cheesecake was very good--decadent Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake, but we found much better versions of this wonderful desert at Juniors in NYC in the theater district and Eilleen's Cheesecake."
"573|1|Great environment, very attentive staff and the food is delicious... The miso salmon is always on point, I really enjoy eating here. I've been there multiple times n I'm always a very happy patron... Chipotle pasta n the bbq wings r a must have also ... Really love that they do takeout also"
574|2|Worst experience. There was leftover food on the silverware and my cup had stickiness on the outside. I got the chicken Alfredo and it taste like they had put shrimp on it and took it off.
575|1|40 min was waiting  time..Service is good..No any good arrangements for people who will be in waiting. You should have really  good patience  to wait..I will suggest  people call them and reserve  table before going..overall good experience. .deserts must try item..cocktails  are OK ok..
"576|2|Went to Cheesecake factory this evening at Newport Mall,JC,NJ.  Though the atmosphere and the waitress are nice the food was not impressive I guess a different cook perhaps.  First of all the 3 of us ordered the Catfish dinner but to only be told they were out of it.  Shrimp scampi watery.  Chose herb crusted salmon was more like blackened salmon. I ate mine, a small bottle of ginger ale is 6 bucks whereas I could have bought a big bottle for $1.99.  Don't know if I would try  this place again.  Oh the manager did give us free buffalo wings after the Catfish episode."
"577|3|I've been to multiple Cheesecake Factory locations and this one is generally unimpressive. For starters the drink I ordered was huge and it was a frozen drink which wasn't specified on the menu.  I don't particularly like frozen drinks and if I would've known I wouldn't have ordered it.  Most of the menu items you couldn't even order. I've worked in the restaurant industry and I know how it can get but it was just a little too disorganized.  The food was just lacking.  It looks nice and all but flavor just falls short.  The wait was a little long to get a table but knowing the business it didn't really bother me too much. It was an OK experience, nothing that really grasped my attention."
578|2|Food was good nonething great but the service was horrible 30 minutes for a glass of water 45 for food sat with empty glasses of drinks  for entire meal won't be back
"579|2|Had an early dinner there today. Waiter was frazzled and forgot to put in orders, food was cold and terrible and soda was flat....worst part... I left my wallet on the table by accident. I take full responsibility for that. I quickly realized I left it and went back to the restaurant.  The waiter claimed he found it on the ground ""kicked under a table"" and gave it in to the manager. After a few moments the waiter returns with my wallet but...All OF THE MONEY THAT WAS IN IT WAS TAKEN over 100.00!!! The manager claimed the waiter never reported the wallet to him. So he lied about that. Obviously the waiter planned to take my wallet home. When I arrived he had a change of heart (or got scared) lied and gave me the wallet back but had already taken the money. That is fucked!! I am glad I have my wallet and credit cards back but really??? I was thrilled my wallet was there and returned but the experience completely soured by the blatant lying and theft of he staff.  The manager said he would investigate it but we all know what that means. So it basically cost me 100 bucks to realize I will never return to that establishment as long as I have a mouth to eat with. I was given a gift card as an xmass gift. I used the card for the food at least. Thanks for the gift of lousy food, failed service and thievery!!! Merry xmass to me. Never go here!! The manager seemed sweet and concerned. Said he would call with news but never did. Corporate, if you read this I expect a 100 gift card on you asap which I will donate to the homeless. The host staff were extremely lovely!! Only good part"
"580|2|The service and management at this Cheesecake Factory located in Newport Mall, Jersey City has gone from poor to terrible. The first time I ever made an attempt to visit was shortly after they opened 2 years ago. I loved the establishment in other locations, and was always pleased with the Miso Salmon dish for nearly 16 years without a problem. I tried to pick up an order at the Newport Mall location shortly after they opened and they kept me on hold for 15-20 minutes or more (sounds unbelievable right...yeah I know, I couldn't believe it either). After all that hold time they still never took my order. I hung up the phone and opted for another restaurant  The last time I visited was last year. I ordered salmon that tasted somewhat like old fish, it was so bad I actually couldn't eat it and had to send it back (something I really hate to do). I then asked for chicken and biscuits as a substitute and they told me it was sold out.  Tonight I went back. We waited 15 minutes to be seated (with no one ahead of us) even though there were empty seats and I was told our wait would be short. Staff was nonchalant about clearing and cleaning the tables that were recently vacated by previous patrons.   I proceeded to the men's restroom once we were seated, and to my surprise there was absolutely no hand soap! I asked staff could i get some soap. After 5 minutes of waiting near the restroom for soap, I saw staff approach the manager who gave a nonchalant gesture toward my direction. Staff then gave a shameful look in my direction and went back to preparing tables. I waited another couple of minutes and approached the same staff, who then went on another search. This time the hostess went to the restroom to check. When she came out of the women's room without soap I asked her for soap. She said ok. Then the manager who wouldn't move to help me before finally comes in my direction to apologize. He blamed the lack of soap on the mall being closed at the time and said they're waiting for a shipment. I didn't believe him. Needless to say, a restaurant should always have soap in the restroom at all times, otherwise the restaurant itself should be closed.   Another 2-3 minutes later the manager comes back with soap from the kitchen. I waited for soap so long until my sister who accompanied me thought something bad possibly happened and told my son to check on me.  I ordered chicken and biscuits. The waitress was pleasant, but my chicken and mashed potatoes was lukewarm, and the biscuits were cold. I was afraid to send it back after the poor service I already received. I begrudgingly ate it with a resolve that I would never return to this establishment again.  This place is giving the Cheesecake Factory franchise a bad reputation. They really need to do something about this. If anyone wants to try Cheesecake Factory, don't go to the Newport Mall Jersey City location. Choose another location, or you might be as disappointed as I was and am now."
"581|2|Would give zero stars if I could. Worst service I've ever experienced. Not sure if our waitress was high or heavily medicated but she knew nothing about the menu, didn't even know what a L.I.T. was.  So disorganized, was seated for a half hour before we even got bread. We got to-go boxes as soon as our entrees came out because we were desperate to get out of there. The best part is we had ordered an entree to go and our waitress brought that out before she brought our entrees to us. Could go on and on but long story short, go to any other cheesecake factory!!"
582|3|Service is extremely slow and you have to search for your server in order to place your order & check. Bread takes long to come out. My drink glass also had lipstick on it. Food is good.
583|2|Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever and this is my favorite restaurant. We waited 2 hours to seat a table of 13 after we were told 45 minutes. We asked multiple times the status of our table for an ETA. Once we were finally seated there was only a table seating for 11 and then they stated we can all just squeeze in. Completely unprofessional and the hostesses were not interested and rude in accommodating us. Not to mention we tried to call ahead to make them aware of the large party we planned on bringing so they would be prepared. I will never return to this location. Once again Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant and this was by far the worst experience.
"584|2|I go to this location very often. The first couple of times it was amazing! But recently, for some odd reason, the service has been terrible. Our entrees come before our appetizers & yesterday I was there with my sister and they brought my meal out first, and hers came out 20 mins after mine. our appetizers came out before our drinks, and to top it off, I ordered a filet mignon, medium rare and it's always either too cooked or undercooked."
"585|2|Below average falafel salad. It  was missing two of the important ingredients, cucumbers and feta. I told the waiter but he could care less. I am usually a fan of Cheesecake Factory but this experience does not make me eager to go back. Disappointing meal indeed!"
"586|1|Lauralie greeted us advised wait time would be 1 hour handed us a pager we were able to roam around until it was time. I've visited other locations Riverside and Willowbrook. This is not an uncommon wait time for a weekend around 4:30pm. This particular location is a nice addition to Newport Mall & Jersey City residents. They didn't offer to validate parking however you can go to the member service to get a discount of $1. Ambiance is ok, food is mediocre lighting is very dim inside. I went on a weekend, you can imagine the traffic. Our server Shaqueria was very attentive and visited our table often about (4 times ). I appreciated her kindness towards us as I informed her this was my first visit at this branch. She seated us comfortably in a section where it wasn't so noisy. Several managers visited our table briefly to ensure we were well taken care of. This is a high volume restaurant that will be successful. Keep smiling associates on the front line &  thank your guests for their patience and business. This is the key to having them return. I look forward to my next week day visit."
"587|2|Great food but lousy, rude service...We came saturday night and expected a long wait, which was fine, but then our buzzers rang and the girl in the front of the restaurant said we were ready, after telling us it's a 15 min wait. Then she told us it was a mistake and the table wasn't ready, which would've been nice to know before making us walk the whole way thru the restaurant. Then our waiter came and took our orders but it took forever for him to come. I had to flag someone else down twice to get the waiter. I ordered a drink and he never delivered my drink. We ordered the hot cheese and spinach dip as the appetizer and it was great. I was then ready to order the main entree and it took him at least a half an hour to come. I ordered my entree (the farfalle with chicken and garlic) and it was very tasty. Had absolutely no complaints and the portion sizes were reasonable. I asked him again for my drink (Mai Tai margarita) and he said he would get it. Second time around, STILL no drink and I decided to just call it quits. Then when we were ready to pay, he did not come back until for another 15 minutes. We assumed to just pay one front register then, until the waiter FINALLY came and said ""where do you think you're going""? I told him we were going to pay in the front and he rudely said ""NO, YOU PAY ME!!"" Well, yes, but you never showed up, so we assumed you forgot, and were just going to go the register which was right next to our table. Should not have even given him a 20% tip given his attitude and his ability to forget my Mai Tai cocktail TWICE. The service was terrible, and while the food was good, the service alone will not make us come back. There are so many better places in the area."
"588|1|We came to cheesecake factory on Sunday December 20th, it had been open for a week at that point. We were promptly informed there was an hour wait. We were not surprised at all so we took a pager and waited out the hour. We got the page on time and went to claim our table. However the host took my fiances name down as Cory which is far from his name, luckily my fiance heard her say cory when she first asked his name and so he remembered that the table for 2 under cory was actually for us lmao. We were seated and then our waitress greeted us promptly. I forgot our waitress name but she also has a cousin who is a waitress there as well and they look like sisters.She was sweet, attentive and funny.They did a good job building the restaurant hard to believe payhalf used to be here it is really nice. But they should have built a bigger waiting area at the host desk because it was jam packed. We had the loaded nachos, crab cakes, macaroni and cheese balls and red velvet cheesecake for dessert. The food was quite tasty but the service was excellent, I hope its not just because it is brand new because everyone was friendly accommodating and checked on us frequently great customer experience. We will be back in the next two weeks"
"589|2|The restaurant looks great but the wait was 1 hrs 15 min to be fair they literally just opened yesterday but still kinda sucked it's Wednesday.we get to the table silverware is directly on the table kinda nasty.there was no water served to the table even after requested by several members of our party.We ordered three Bar Drinks but only got two, ordered three sodas and the sprite was a bit flat the Coke was perfect. Bread was served once after about a half hour of sitting at a table with nothing but two of the three bar drinks we ordered.the appetizers came out and looked great food was delicious.entree was next and again delicious even though the burgers looked like brown snowballs instead of a patty but the taste was quality good food.we ordered cheesecake slices to go and our check. We literally sat there for 15 min waiting for our check and our Togo cheesecake. Waitress finally comes with our check but no cheesecake it was very clear she forgot. She did come back with the cheesecake but that was like another 10 min wait.overall the Wait to sit plus dinner this took like 3 hours."
590|2|First time to this location.  Been to MANY locations over the past 15 years.  Was first introduced to beets in west palm beach fl location as a mistake but fell in LOVE with the country French salad.   I ordered it in JC tonight and wow did it fall short!!!Mixed greens with the slightest coating of dressing NO beets and NO goat cheese.  Whoever is on salads needs to be let go!!!!    Beets and cheese came quickly as server was totally on it. Soo sorry!!No prob.....salad is completed with more dressing and yummy just like always.  just like all other visits to other locations (I travel for a living so).  Ordered a tasty farfalle cream chicken and roasted garlic dish.  So tasty.   Sadly it was WAY short on the chicken.  Not sure if this is corporate policy or new mgmt trying to impress corporate.  We left here in November and are back now for our season.  This location has opened since we left and WE were exited to try out the new spot as we love the experience most always  elsewhere.  So indeed a few more times at this location (2min walk from marina) will be in order.  Usually newly opened restaurants don't hold back on the ingredients hope this is just an off night.  Love this place usually    Fire and oak has been our go to for 10 years now.  Just saying.
591|2|I read the warnings about the bad service and disorganization but figured they would have it worked out by now - I was wrong! We were quoted a 30min wait and after an hour we had to leave and go upstairs to the food court otherwise we would have missed our movie. There were several empty tables that were still messy from there previous guests and most people there all looked the same - frustrated at either waiting for their table or waiting for their food.
"592|2|WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Waited 30 mins for appetizer, and 45 minutes for the main entree, and when our food came, the order was all wrong!! Do not waste your money here!!"
593|1|My favorite place to come for breakfast since I live in Newport. Their Juevos rancheros are so good. I have tried every restaurants Juevos rancheros in the area including a high end steak house and Cheececake factory is still better and was less expansive.  Yum.
594|2|This place deserves no stars after my experience last night. I went out with my fiancé and best friend for dinner my best friend suggested this location since it was closer to home. I had order the chicken madeira as I do at all Cheesecake Factory's I go to. I received my food after waiting 20 mins later I was so hungry as I cut into my food I find my chicken to be semi pink I showed my friend and she just thought it was just me until I cut into the edge then she noticed my chicken was raw we called a waiter over which he was willing to get the manager I hate !!! Returning food I never do but my chicken was raw and I refuse ! To get sick. The manager ran out and was very kind he had asked me if I wanted a Cheesecake ... I responded no thank you I just want my chicken madeira I was very hungry... 15 mins goes by ( thinking their remaking my meal) are waitress came back to us with the check telling me they removed the meal from are bill. My friend asked if they were bringing me a new one remind you I've been here for about a hour my fiancé and friend had ate while I still haven't had anything. She tells us she didn't know she would check I told her if it wasn't made I didn't want it anymore. Well it was never made I was literally offered Cheesecake over a meal that I waited over a hour for. I will NOT be going back to this location. Just a heads up check your food before and if your offered Cheesecake take it ! Because your meal isn't being remade while you wait.
595|2|This location served me raw catfish and never got a glass a water till after the incident with my dinner. The server was sweet and nice just not attentive.
"596|3|I've been to this location quite a few times.  The food is consistently good.  Service is attentive, aside from once or twice when they seems short staffed.  They almost never get my order right though."
597|2|Leave it up to Jersey City and the Newport Mall to screw up the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is great as they all are but the service is awful.  Been 3 times and the incompetency is consistent.
"598|2|Came here last night for valentines dinner and I was very disappointed! I love the cheesecake factory which is why I chose to take my girlfriend here but this location was awful. We usually go to the one in short hills, and we never have an issue! We waited almost an hour to get a table which I understand being that it was Friday night and valentines weekend, but to wait an hour and then have a bad experience was not how I wanted to spend my valentines dinner. First the bread was hard and burnt, then we were served water without straws! My girlfriend ordered lugini pasta which she figured would be long spaghetti type noodles but it was cut up and honesty looked like a plate of cabbage..she barely ate any of it. I got the 4 cheese pasts which was delicious and cant ever complain about that. I ordered coffee and the waited forgot the milk. Speaking of the waiter (James M), Anything we asked for, he brought out one at a time, which made us wait even longer. We then asked for a slice of cheesecake to go and was brought out on a plate. Was not happy with this location at all."
