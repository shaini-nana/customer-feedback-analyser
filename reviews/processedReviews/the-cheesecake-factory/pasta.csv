"they gave my sister the wrong pasta dish, the supervisor removed it from the bill and offered her another dish."
"i got the pasta carbonara and i forget the exact name of my husband's dish, but it was breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus."
my pasta was creamy and flavorful.
"we ordered 3 entrees and an appetizer i had the stuffed mushrooms, my best friend had tomato basil pasta and her dad had the carne asada."
we also had the filet mignon which was standard and the evelyns favorite pasta that was recommended by the waitress.
"our server, ariana, was super friendly and personable.i ordered the tomato basil chicken pasta in the carle place location and though it tasted good, it was dry and less seasoned."
i had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken and i swapped out the angel hair pasta for linguini.
and pasta was over cooked.
pasta was overcooked to the point in was inedible.
"great choice of american food, burgers, pizza, pasta and of course cheesecakes (my love :)), maybe around 20 types of all tastes."
the pasta wasn't spicy.
"but before cheesecake we orders cajun shrimp pastas, crab it's were awesome and the pot stickers are tasty."
"?we ordered hibachi hangar steak with onions & shiitake mushrooms,  with wasabi mashed potatoes, & tempura asparagus, and carbonara pasta."
"on to the carbonara, it was super watery.. & i know that when you make pasta you usually have to put it into a sautee pan with some pasta water and sauce to coat the pasta well."
obviously they added too much pasta water in the process.now on to the service.
"we came with the mind to order the pasta and cheesecake, however the pasta was way damn filling(but delish) and we couldn't fit the cheesecake."
"(thanks for that, cheesecake factory) i ordered the four cheese pasta, it was unexpectedly good because hearing 4 cheese it might be too cheesy, but it's actually not."
"my fiend ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta and it was actually really good, a bit spicy( for her, for me it tasted so weak spicy haha) but i personally thought it was a bit salty."
my friend order of shrimp w/ angel hair pasta.
"i had the farfalle pasta, it was very good."
asked for steak and shrimp combo with pasta instead of mash potatoes.
"and they had the nerve to leave the middle of my plate empty where the pasta was supposed to be and say ""pasta is coming out soon."""
pasta was hard and not boiled.
chicken marsala and mushroom w. bowtie pasta (forgot the name)- more to the sweeter side but still good.
their pastas are terrific as well but i mainly went to try the chocolate tuxedo cake for my birthday and it was like a dream!
love getting the chipotle chicken pasta and their margaritas and mojitos.
boy was i wrong   ..i ordered the spicy jambalaya with pasta.
when i stuck my fork in it literally picked up a lump if pasta and right away it just didn't seem right i assumed maybe i just needed to taste it.
one of my favorites is the garlic creamy pasta - it is sooo delicious and hearty.
"on a wednesday afternoon, after the dinnertime rush, my party of three waited over an hour for our meal - two pasta dishes and a chicken sandwich."
"after a long wait with no entrees, we were told there were no more mashed potatoes and gluten-free pasta and told to pick alternatives."
"instead of gluten-free pasta, we ordered an omelet but it was dry that i thought the egg was a tortilla."
the pineapple chicken didn't have much pineapple and the pasta with it was already dry on the top.
"fried zucchini was alright, not the greatest, the smell of it irritated me, but it was okay.margarita pizza, delicious.alfredo pasta, it was alright."
orders garlic pasta with shrimps.
i got the bistro shrimp pasta and my friend got the eggplant parm.
"we had the clam chowder, steak diane, and spicy chicken chipotle pasta."
"i was in the mood for pasta and shrimp, it's important to know exactly what you want or in the mood for because  they have a large menu."
"i settled on the shrimp and sausage pasta, it was very flavorful but the portion was small."
terrible service and long waits for food as we asked for gluten free pasta.
the pasta tasted like lemon+sugar and nothing else.
half the pasta was not finished.8.
"for reference, we ordered the lunch bbq chicken salad and lunch louisiana pasta while they each had more complex meals that should take longer to prepare."
"they were finished with their meal when our server finally came over to tell us it would be about 5 more minutes, they were just waiting on the pasta."
"then we finally ordered i had a carbonara, my friend had the pasta napolitano, and my other friend had the four-cheese pasta."
"first no bread, second no utensils, third learn what medium rare is and chicken pasta was so salty!"
my mom had the louisiana pasta which i had a taste of.
"when we first got there, our waiter gave us a moment however he seemed to have disappeared for 20 min, after we ordered our food but we didn't have any utensils and again our waiter was gone for a long time, i ordered a pasta and spilled sauce on my white shirt, after i did laundry the stain is still visible sadly, also we wanted to order desserts but again the waiter spent about 30 min to follow his dreams or something, wasn't my best experience but maybe i'll try it again"
i got the shrimp pasta which came as a huge portion i was able to have it for dinner lunch and dinner again the next day lol my boyfriend got the bbq chicken salad which was huge but he enjoyed it as well and finished it that night.
"the main dishes were okay, i had the hibachi steak and the cajun jambalaya pasta."
"food was inedible, barley any chicken in my chipotle  chicken pasta dish."
burger and carbonara pasta just so so.
"i do not think we will be going back to this location, but i like to give people another chance, but would like to stress that we were highly disappointed in the service and food quality.would not recommend the shrimp with angel hair pasta (very bland), chicken marsala (which is normally good, but it was sweet and something was off) and spicy pasta with chicken (just wasn't good)almost forgot to add we also ordered cheesecake which is the highlight of the place, but the cheesecake was semi frozen!"
i loved my favorite appetizer spinach dip but i wasn't the fan of the pasta i had ordered for meal.
"i ordered 4-cheese pasta, sister got lemon-herb roasted chicken and substituted mashed potatoes for cilantro rice, my partner got pasta with shrimp and sausage."
my 4-cheese pasta was ok.
now for partner's pasta...
ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage which was pretty good.
i got pasta which included mushrooms.
we also ordered pasta but the noodles seemed to be overcooked and soggy.
"i asked for a pasta instead, who which she said ""better late than never"" when she handed it to me."
"then it went down from here after my girlfriend and i order, we order a appetizer (factory nachos) pasta and a burger (bacon bacon)."
i usually opt for their shrimp & angel hair pasta.
"for example, i ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta and it had great flavor but the shrimp  were way over cooked and were chewy as rubber."
"fast forward we are eating the food of course we had to warm up the food because it was cold.the food had to no favor, the pasta had no sauce and the chicken parmigiana sandwich had the two smallest pieces of chicken in it ( more bread than anything) smh what a disappointment to make matters worst my mom was eating her broccoli and chicken pasta we substitute the rigatoni with linguine and she stops and pulls out a long white string out of  her mouth !!!!"
the pasta dishes in particular are some of my favorite.
very good place we tried the spicy chicken chipotle pasta in the chicken pot stickers with some white wine and pineapple cherry limeade it was amazing each dish was so well made it had so many flavours.
ordered the cajun spicy pasta substituted the bowtie pasta for angel hair... delicious!
"once we finally got our food, my pasta carbonara was dry as hell."
this is probably last time we will visit to cheesecake factory due to poor services we got therewhen we went there wait time was 20 min ok  still we tolerated and sat for  35 minwhen we got table  being vegetarian we asked for veg berger and beerwe were served beer with flat bread which were ordered then lady who took our orders came with information that do not have veg berger's as they do not made today as we have already started taking beer we were not able to go to next berger barwhen we ordered vegi pasta and soft tacos we were served very tasteless dishes with some boiled cauliflower without any dressingon the top of this we were charged for chiken pasta and chiken tacosbill no 0728table 3319:54 on 21dec2018if you are vegetarian do not visit to this worst factory at all and shell out hefty dollars for nothingadd to this complementary bread with cheese was served along with main course as they said bread was in oven ???????
"we ordered the loaded baked potato tots and the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, but only received our appetizer."
she gave us some water and said she will check up on our pasta.
"called in ordered for pickup, angel hair pasta with shrimp."
"he got the crispy chicken with pasta dish, which got better with each bite."
the food was too salty for some of the family but the pasta was great for others.
"generally speaking they were pretty good.for entrees the portion size is ridiculous - if you had appetizers and want to save room for dessert, there's no way to finish a pasta dish without having some left over."
"i had the louisiana chicken pasta, which was very tasty but a little bit on the oily side.for dessert we shared a selection of cheesecakes."
we ordered tomato basil pasta.
"despite telling him we're vegetarians, he brought us chicken pasta and we accidentally ate it."
"right from tacos to burgers to pastas, everything is sweet!"
the pasta was bland and literally tasted like tomato sauce right out of a can.
i informed the waiter that i couldn't eat it because the pasta was wrong and it lacked everything promised in the menu.
who cooked my nasty shrimp pasta???
spicy chipotle veggie pasta - out of this world amazinggg 100000/103.
coffee cheesecake - 10/10i'll highly recommend the spicy chipotle veggie pasta if you are a vegetarian like me and loves spicy food.
i got the pasta carbonara (non-lunch menu) and it was decently sized.
"everything from the bread, to the pasta to the cosmopolitan to the cheesecake was great."
i almost wish there was a better timer to manage it - the bread and the delays in drinks didn't help.fried avocado/mushroom/zucchini appetizer came 20 minutes after my pasta...odd.
i would've canceled it had antonella not been so nice about it.the pasta da vinci is actually quite good - not nearly as salty and a very mild sauce with mushrooms and chicken balancing the penne.
"better experience, though portions seem to have gotten smaller - the last time i had pasta here, it was 2x the meal."
food took way too long to serve and it was just pasta and cold bu the way!
"tomato basil pasta is always great, but it is a huge portion."
"the pasta was al dente, the chicken was perfectly fried and the arugula was tossed in a nice dressing!"
my biggest disappointment with the dish was the lack of flavor in the pasta.
it was coated in a basil dressing or oil and on the sides of the plate was a cream sauce which was very well needed throughout the entire pasta part of the dish.
"without it, the pasta was bland and just there."
when it arrived i noticed my pasta was extremely over cooked.
"i went for the same pasta, instead i got shrimp instead of chicken in it."
their pastas are great and salad too and everything!!!
"i felt the pasta was little dry.talking about the service,it wasn't great."
we ordered the smokehouse burger with sweet potato fries and i had the bow tie chicken pasta with a garlic sauce (i forgot what it's called).
my pasta was pretty good.
"i ordered rigatoni pasta, it was raw, extremely al-dente(so hard to chew) and had no taste.."
talked to manager had him changed to four cheese pasta for to-go!
when i got back they had packed chicken pasta for me..
i ordered  pasta da vinci it was awesome.
i got the pasta carbonara which was good and also my favorite toasted marshmallow cheesecake.
the amount of pasta they gave me was in abundance compared to other places and it was spicy!
wife's pasta came out cold.
"i ordered the jambalaya pasta and was underwhelmed, especially with the fact that the shrimp were not deveined and properly cleaned."
"shrimp angel hair pasta, shrimp was way over cooked, tough  my dish orange chicken, mash was cold, veggies way over cooked."
best pasta in town?
the pasta is so hard my stomach hurts.
i've been there multiple times n i'm always a very happy patron... chipotle pasta n the bbq wings r a must have also ... really love that they do takeout also
my girlfriend ordered lugini pasta which she figured would be long spaghetti type noodles but it was cut up and honesty looked like a plate of cabbage..she barely ate any of it.
