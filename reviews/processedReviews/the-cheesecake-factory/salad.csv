i believe it was a manager who came to apologize to us and explain that i will get a free salad or soup to make up for the wait.

"the salad arrived and it was missing edamame, radicchio and cucumbers ( annoying) i let a new bartender now about that."
"the missing items arrived, i dumped them in my salad, then realized that edamame was frozen."

but when my bill arrived i was surprised to see a salad was still on the bill.
i ordered the almond crusted salmon salad.
"the drinks were watered down taste like lemonade , we ordered a mango and avocado salad that took 45 minutes , once  that arrived it was a soggy salad with no avocado and a horrible presentation, i requested for the bill and this entire lunch experience took 3 hours , i was surprised they did not want to bring me my check after i requested and waited 10 minutes , this place is horrible , don't go to the cheesecake factory , go to the one in long island it's amazing"

"yeah, let me put 1 ounce of fish on a salad...great idea lol!"
"jokes aside, it was a mockery of a salad - ""the worst i ever had,"" said my poor grandmother in sorrow and depression."
"my grandmother went off on how trash the salad was, and rightfully called the manager and gave him a piece of her mind, too."
"as a plus, the manager took the salads off the check, which was very kind of him to do."
"a respectable gesture, but, to be fair, it should of been done if an upscale place like cheesecake factory messes up a salad - something that is very difficult to do as is."

"you don't charge $18 for a salad that has no premium ingredients on there, ever."
"we got the chicken pot stickers, chicken samosas, salmon, beet and goat cheese salad, and the crispy chicken sandwich."
"the beet and goat cheese salad was probably the favorite dish of the night.from the entrees, the salmon was just ok and the crispy chicken sandwich was just better than average."

"after the girl's got their food sans the salad, the waiter said her manager was insisting on charging for the salad substitution."
"smh 15 minutes later and no manager, no salad, then the waiter said she'd bring one and eventually she did."
the ceaser salad dressing was too garlicky for my liking.

the flavors of the salad were pretty well balanced and adequate.
their pastas are great and salad too and everything!!!
"- it's very baaaadthe salad portions [full sized portion ordered]  are extremely smallthe beer - unless you are seated at the bar - never arrivesif you cancel the beer order - as it never arrived, and order a double shot of glenlivet on the rocksit arrives neat [no ice] - in a wine bowl [i assure you it was not a whisky glass]and the management is shameless enough to not rectify any of their service related issues - absolutely not apologeticavoid this place"
"we each had a salad, my mil the chopped which was quite a generous portion and i had the seared tuna salad."
"i will say that for the $19 price tag on this salad, it could have had more than 3 slices of the tuna but that would be my only complaint."
"everyone else got their usual dishes, veggie burger, burgers and wellness salad."
"i hate the fact that they got rid of my favorite salad, the luau salad, from back in the day."

"i recommend the chicken, mango, avocado salad and the sheila's chicken and avocado salad.i have never dined here but only have gotten take out a few times."
