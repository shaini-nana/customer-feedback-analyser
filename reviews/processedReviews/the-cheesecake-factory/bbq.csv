"for reference, we ordered the lunch bbq chicken salad and lunch louisiana pasta while they each had more complex meals that should take longer to prepare."
i got the shrimp pasta which came as a huge portion i was able to have it for dinner lunch and dinner again the next day lol my boyfriend got the bbq chicken salad which was huge but he enjoyed it as well and finished it that night.
smokehouse bbq burger was good but it was to come with crispy onions that were more oil Â than onion.
i've been there multiple times n i'm always a very happy patron... chipotle pasta n the bbq wings r a must have also ... really love that they do takeout also
