my foot long chicken breast was made to order and looked presentable.
the chicken and the assortment of vegetables i chose was as it should be.
"bread tastes fake, chicken tastes like crap, and anything other than the $5 footlongs are overpriced.but it was late, so i stopped in for the black forest ham $5 footlong."
i was given a single chicken serving when in fact i had asked for a double chicken chopped salad.
my favorite is the rotisserie chicken & caesar salad.
"i sure am at a loss for when i first walked into a subway franchise.type of cuisine: fast, healthy food by way of easy-to-prepare sandwiches, made to order - right in front of the customer - using freshly baked breads, select sauces and a variety of fresh, delicious toppings.ambiance: this subway location, similar to other subway's, but found in the ballston common mall food court, has a kiosk set-up with yellow tones, plastic and laminate, food court seating and an order counter with the toppings for each sandwich in plain view behind the plexi-glass window panel.what i ordered: my husband ordered a foot-long oven crisp chicken sandwich ($5.50) on whole wheat bread."
"in the mood for a salad, i turned the turkey avocado sandwich ($5.50) into a salad (additional $0.75 for one scoop of avocado): with shredded lettuce, tomato, green bell peppers, red onion, olives, sliced pepperoncinis, two strips of bacon, a small ice cream scoop of squished avocado and chicken instead of turkey, topped with a honey-mustard dressing.what i loved: easily accessible, convenient location and a quick, relatively inexpensive take-out dinner.why i loved it: i loved sharing our first meal, together, as husband and wife in our new apartment!cost: low to average ($5-$8 per sandwich/salad)"
next time i think i'll go with the chicken breast.
"then i ordered a chicken, ranch, bacon melt only to find out they're out of ranch, again after they made the sandwich."
"this is my husband's review.very bad customer service, Â very rude cashier(staff).march 6,2020 @10:20pmcloses 11:00pm but looks like they're about to close because they already kept half of their stuff.i nicely ask for a foot long wheat bread, he asked me what meat i politely answered plain chicken, he asked me again like he was pissed i answered again politely."
"he asked me again ""which one, teriyaki chicken?"
"i politely answered again""plain chicken, the regular one"", he rudely asked me again and showed me he was pissed ""man which one?"""
and my favorite soup is chicken noodles
"not only did it take them ten minutes to make a simple chicken bacon ranch salad, but then i found multiple hairs in my salad."
