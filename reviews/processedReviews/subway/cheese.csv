the steak & cheese was terrible!
"i had asked for provalone cheese, lettuce, tomatirs, pickles, black olives, and those awesome red peppers."
when i asked for mozzarella cheese on my meatballs they said the only choice i had was provolone.
"i asked to substitute the steak on a steak, egg, and cheese on flatbread for turkey, the sandwich maker refused, i asked why, he said that he couldn't, which i know not to be the case since i typically purchase breakfast from the columbia pike location only a mile up the road from this pentagon city location."
"they assumed what i wanted on my sandwich, which they didn't get right at all and when i asked them to change the cheese from american to cheddar they just ignored me and kept making it."
when i get a steak and egg and cheese they give me just a thimble amount of steak
"the ladies there for some reason always have enough bread, enough meats, cheese, and veggies to have a sandwich for me regardless of the time of the work day.the only bad thing is that there is no toaster machine here so i have to eat my sandwiches cold."
"however, i let it pass and asked for cheddar cheese and when i saw that they added very little to my sandwich, i thought that oor favir they would add a little more cheese and silvia replied that that could not be, that she gave me the exact measurement,  as far as i know legally, a measurement is not done by hand but by a meter."

"i decided on the ruben, and had a sandwich with the bread not toasted, meat was cold after biting into it and cheese only partially melted."
she threw the cheese back in the container.
"ordered italian herbs n cheese, with tuna."
i went for the foot long meatball marinara with provolone cheese.
"i ended up ordering the steak sriracha w/ pepper jack cheese, mayo, spinach, onions, olives, salt, pepper & oregano on flat bread....it was missing oil & vinegar but i guess by me making it a combo i was able to get salt & vinegar chips which satisfied that taste."
went to this subway for a turkey reuben and they don't even carry rye bread or swiss cheese.
he was literally running around and refilling the bins for the veggies and cheese.
