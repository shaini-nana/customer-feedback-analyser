"1|1|The foods great, I love the salads. The service was nice and I always come here. Because it's near my house. Nice when I just want to walk and grab some food. :)"
2|2|Horrible service dont come to this subway they charged me on th app and didnt give me the food
3|2|I was just insulted for no reason All I wanted is a tuna sandwich I love subway but it's always bad treatment when I go there except for the old guy with the mustache
4|2|Terrible customer service from the Indian woman who works here- don't go to this subway.
"5|1|Every time I come here I have a good experience, not sure what other reviewers are complaining about. I live within walking distance and the food is always good, and the employees are always friendly and chatty."
6|2|DO NOT COME HERE!!!Horrible Service... Owner doesn't care about the clients and he's rude and bad spoken!There's much better Subways around the area...
"7|2|This is Subway.  It is a national chain that specializes in making depressing, overpriced and substandard sandwiches.  One goes to the Subway when they have no other resort, or when they make the mistake that the coupon they got will make it taste better.  This location is small, and average at best."
"8|1|I'm surprised by the other reviews. The employees were the kindest people ever and knew exactly what ""light on the lettuce"" meant. Would say it's the better of subways in the area (there are four)."
"9|2|Ok...seriously don't even bother going to this Subway!  Nothing spells ""cheap"" like this Subway.  I ordered a cold club, w/o ham sub roast beef. The sandwich maker put in 2 slices, count them, 1 & 2 SLICES of roast beef---on a footlong! WTF is up w/that?  I've only had a frugal experience w/ this subway location.And they've got that catchy phrase ""$5...$5....$5... footlong""...ummmm...there was nothing $5 about my footlong!! The thing freakin cost me $8, just for the sandwich alone!! I don't think a cold cut sandwich food tax is $3 dude!What a rip off..pssshh!"
10|2|This place sucks.. Its clean but the food isnt the same as other subways. The steak & cheese was terrible! Never going back to this place.
"11|1|I stopped in here today for lunch because I happened to see the place in the same shoppng center where I was at. I knew that they have the deal of the day, which amounts to a special promotion for a particula sub based upon the partucular day.  Today was the turkey breast dandwich for $3.99.  That sounded like a healthy option for me, so I figured why not!  There was a snall line but practicalky nobody eating inside of the restaurant. I had asked for provalone cheese, lettuce, tomatirs, pickles, black olives, and those awesome red peppers. I skipped the chios and drink, and the 6"" sub was sufficient for a quick lunch.  The sub tasted good and there were ni issues to report. The people working behind the counter were nice also!"
"12|2|I decided to eat at Subway for the first time in many years, and now I remember why I never go here anymore. Wheat bread tasted like cardboard and wasn't too fresh. Had the tuna with lettuce, tomato, onion, and some vinegar. I managed to finish the sandwich, but that's the best thing I could say right now. When I was younger, I would come to Subway quite often since the footlong is quite a bit of food at a cheap price. The sandwiches here just don't make the cut for me anymore. It's garbage. Their slogan is ""eat fresh"". What a joke. I will never return unless some outside force posseses me."
13|2|I just ordered a meatball sandwich given that I like meatball sandwiches and it's the sandwich of the day. When I asked for mozzarella cheese on my meatballs they said the only choice I had was provolone. I've never been to a subway where I didn't get to choose what toppings I wanted on my meat. I would have understood if they didn't have mozzarella but they did! They just didn't want to let me have it my way
"14|2|Hey Supervisor or Manager,I don't know who your two uneducated broads were that were working on 4/23/18 at 9:30pm sharp, but I hope you know their training and communication was evidentially shit. I came at 9:25 and these two were wrapping up/closing (which I understand as a dining service associate) but to come off as if you were a burden to them and interrupting their process just rubs me the wrong way. In short, customer service skills need a lot of work. I don't care for whatever personal issues might've been going through their minds that time or if they wanted the shop empty to expedite their process, but I hope you're all smart enough to figure out that the perception from customers is key here. Business comes first. Doesn't take too much common sense to figure that out. Or in this case, there may be a special needs requirement for those two to comprehend appropriately. Don't like what you're reading it? FIX IT. Nimrods."
"15|1|This is my favorite Subway location. I always receive great service, they go above and beyond for the customers. Delicious food and very nice people working there!"
"16|2|Everytime I come in, they seem to be out of exactly the meat I want, without fail. The first time I just chalked it up as an honest mistake due to imperfect foresight. I get it, there's only a finite amount of food at any restaurant, it's only natural that every so often inventory doesn't meet demand. These things happen, I can move past that. I go in, a week and a half, two weeks later. Again, no meatballs. Since I was intending to use a Subway coupon, it would make sense that I would just move on to the next location, especially if it's directly in my route anyway. Upon mentioning this to the employee, she told me to ""hang on"" and disappeared in the back, returning without so much as an explanation, with exactly the number of meatballs needed for a 12"". I didn't think much of it at the time, I just saw it as a miracle of convenience. A third time, nearly a month later, I return, place my same order, and was given a familiar ""we have no more meatballs."" I insisted, explaining what happened last time. They just kind of sat in silence. I didn't have time to play detective, I just ate somewhere else. Attempt #4, 2 weeks later. Same outcome. I figure, there's no way 4 times in a row they'll be ""out of meatballs,"" and when I actually put some real energy into those thoughts, I cast serious doubt on the odds of the only thing I've ever ordered from subway, since I was old enough to eat at subway, which has never once ran out before, that the likelihood of it happening again would be infinitesimal. Today, I ordered another meatball sub, and this time, I added a tuna sandwich to my order. Not only where there once again no meatballs, but it seems, as chance would have it, the only other thing I order would also happen to be all gone. I was speechless; any possible reactively hostile emotion or belligerent response was so completely overwhelmed by stunned bewilderment. I almost never write negative reviews, as a matter of fact, i hardly write reviews at all. I just simply don't go to a bad place again, or continue returning to a good place. My experience here, it was so outlandish and bizarre that I felt it must be shared."
17|2|Not a friendly staff and the dude behind the cash register doesn't know what he is doing!  Won't be back...
"18|2|Stoic unpleasant service at this location. A fairly tasteless, sparse portion of meat with way too much bread. After a numbers of years of eating Subway and in recent news hearing that certain toxic ingredients in the food, I'll be taking my business to Fire House Subs.If you haven't heard of them, they're great. Lots of local athletic boosters and fundraisers for Firefighting associations. The sandwiches are AMAZING. They're also less then a minute from this Subway, across the shopping center. Support local area businesses and stop lining the pockets of greedy franchisees that could careless about the customer. Sorry guys, this Subway reminds me of being at the DMV where English isn't a requirement by the staff and I'm left walking away with a bad taste in my mouth...."
"19|2|Not only was I overchared, the quality of both sandwiches was sub par.  Upon acting upon the ""If it is not right, I'll make it right guarantee,  I was treated to a litany of excuses by the owner.  The establishment was also extremely dirty, with fruit flies circling the produce.  The owner Abera is a complete jerk!  Please do not frequent this Subway location, as the employees cannot understand and process simple directives in english."
"20|2|While the food is fantastic, the service was slow.Our server just seemed like in no rush to make the order, meanwhile the line was getting longer, and longer... and longer.The Subway at Hayfield Shopping Center is friendly, and fast."
"21|1|I've been coming here for over a year, so thought it warranted an update. Good news for them is that I find they're one of the better Subway shops I've been to (and I've been to heaps!). Bad news for me is that in the last few months they, like so many other franchisees, seem to have decided to use old bread, which is such a shame because this really is one of the better ones around anywhere. I come here almost every week, and the stale bread has become very noticeable, and started spoiling the whole sandwich. It feels horribly hard and crumbly, smells awful, and tastes even worse. It's now become usual for me to not be able to eat the whole bread, but instead year off chunks of it at both ends and just eat meats and veggies. If anyone at this shops reads this, I really hope they care enough to stop using old bread, or stop using the any packaging that says ""eat fresh,"" because it's impossible for me to as it is. Apart from serving stale bread, this shop does a great job of maintaining overall cleanliness and not abusing ingredients. Staff are generally friendly and efficient, and I'd like to be able to keep coming here if only they'd stop using old bread."
"22|2|Had a very odd experience just now. I asked to substitute the steak on a Steak, Egg, and Cheese on flatbread for Turkey, the sandwich maker refused, I asked why, he said that he couldn't, which I know not to be the case since I typically purchase breakfast from the Columbia Pike location only a mile up the road from this Pentagon city location. I had decided to go to the Pentagon City location because I had a little more time to stop. I regret that decision now because I asked the sandwich maker why he couldn't substitute the meat, and he says that it costs more, which I would expect, I assume different stores operate differently. I said okay, and the sandwich maker looked puzzle as I stood there. He asked if if I still wanted it. I said yes. He shook his head begrudgingly and headed for the Turkey compartment, and begins to prepare my sandwhich, never asking what type of bread, only six inch or foot long. Good thing he chose the bread I wanted. I would hate to make another change to inconvenience or complicate this man's day.I pay for my item and stand at register for a second, the puzzled look comes on the sandwich maker's face again. He asks, anything else? I ask for my receipt. He prints it out, I take it, and leave.Now sitting in my office enjoying a very good sandwich, I notice my receipt. I will attach a photo to show you all I am not making this up: He changes me for a tuna sandwich with extra tuna!?! LoL! What is that about!?! Certainly people can and do make substitutions at subway often. Isnt that a byproduct of eating fresh?‍I feel that I was over charged and underserved. The moral of the story here. Stay on the menu, improvised sandwiches will cost you."
"23|2|Eat fresh more like Eat hairThe workers had no hospitality. They assumed what I wanted on my sandwich, which they didn't get right at all and when I asked them to change the cheese from American to cheddar they just ignored me and kept making it. They assumed I wanted toasted sandwich toasted, which I did not want. And they did not use gloves to make the sandwich. Then to top it off I bit into a long greasy hair then found I opened the sandwich to find another hair. Overall disgusting and I will not be going there again"
"24|2|It seems that this subway was was not only absent from yelp it also lacked any reviews. So, I guess I must tend to my duties as a yelp reviewer. First, let me say that this place is a madhouse due to all these annoying out-of-towners! The sandwich makers greeted me far better than expected, for what they had to endure from the customers in front of me. I can't believe the level of disrespect and rudeness they receive?!?! My foot long chicken breast was made to order and looked presentable. Unfortunately, when I bit into it I noticed that wasn't as fresh (bread) as I have come to expect from subway. The chicken and the assortment of vegetables I chose was as it should be. The cup of water I receive with my meal was yellow, which I assume was because the fountain was shared  with another soft drink....I hope!!!"
25|1|Blown away! This place goes above and beyond. Best sandwich place.You step up to the counter. You tell the person what type of sandwich you want. Then comes the bread. They have four of five different types. And bottomless toppings (olives included)
26|2|They sucked. I didn't even get the right sandwich when they handed it me and they were rude
"27|2|This subway is bad. When the line is busy, your food get rushed. The service is rude and I don't like it. But, I have to give it another star because at least the food was good. But the service was bad."
"28|3|Lines can be long but it's better than the rest of the food court slop. Wait in line and at least you know you won't get dysentery from the food, unlike most of the rest of the food court."
"29|3|Based on the map, I'm pretty sure this is the one I visited.  It was 10:30pm and I needed something to eat, and everything was either closed or didn't look appealing at the time.  I'll be the first to admit I don't like Subway at all.  Bread tastes fake, chicken tastes like crap, and anything other than the $5 footlongs are overpriced.But it was late, so I stopped in for the Black Forest Ham $5 footlong.  Service was great and friendly, I got my sandwich toasted with the toppings I wanted, and it tasted fresher than any other Subways I've been to.Their credit card machine was down, so cash only.  And another customer in line said their Diet Coke was out of stock for days.  But all in all, the best Subway I've been to, which to me isn't saying as much as it should."
"30|1|Of the many Subway's I have been to, this one is very good.  The service is fast, so don't let the long lines fool you.  Unlike some of the lesser Subway's, this one always has fresh vegetables and fresh bread.  Of all the places in the Pentagon City food court, Subway is one of the most consistent, giving good food and fast service."
"31|3|It's a Subway. There are so many of them, it's hard to keep track of, with the intended pun. Just like the dull pennies you can find without looking, this location is at a fairly busy shopping center. Thankfully it's not too insane, and it seems they do steady business, but I appreciate the relative tranquility of this store. It's got some nice decor of their items on wood panels, to include bread, onions, tomatoes, and green peppers. The seating area is fairly comfortable, but there are no high tables that us taller guys prefer.Ultimately it's a clean restaurant. A friendly staff are both pleasant and helpful. My best guess is this franchise owner doesn't like or run, some of the specials seen at other ones. This is a good one though, and the potato chips rack keeps things organized. If in the area it's worth it. It's convenient to Columbia Pike, and is close to Baileys Crossroads and Lincolnia."
"32|2|I know you might think that all Subways are the same, but this one is below average.  First, the location is not very accessible considering it is in a high traffic area with a two-lane highway.Second, the meat was at least, a day old.  It was very visible of the color changing from being out in the air for too long.  Third, I was not greeted when I entered the location.  Actually, I was treated as if I was a bother since they the guys were counting money.Considering Subways are a dime a dozen, I would continue driving until you reached the next location."
"33|2|The sign on the menu board offered a $5.00 foot long meatball sub, which is the $5.00 special sub for October. To my chagrin, I was charged $5.50 plus tax.I won't be singing ""$5.50 foot long"" Subway jingle anytime soon."
"34|2|Agree on these reviews! If I could give 0 stars I would! Worse customer service ever! !! I thought all Subways are the same but clearly they are not! I asked a lady if they have a discount that the one on Linconia gives! She looked at me like "" what are you talking about""! Then I explained and she said ""never heard of that"" I asked at the one on Linconia and they say all Subways should give military/officers discount! You should know the policies of your work!!! Never going to this Subway again!"
35|2|I was given a single chicken serving when in fact I had asked for a double chicken chopped salad. This happened on two occasions. Skip to the next subway if you really want to eat a sandwich or a salad.
"36|2|If u could give no stars I would! Very rude Asian lady! Told me I would be charged xtra for mayo! Lol! Really? Since when? Then when I went to pay I handed her a $20 my total was 8.09, I tried to hand her the .09 change and she said I can't take it I already entered 20 even! Lmao never again"
"37|2|Not good. Was here on a weekend afternoon, the place was empty. There was an older small lady behind the counter and a younger guy/kid. They guy was somewhat helpful and proficient, but the old lady was stingy and a pain. Everything I asked for felt like an inconvenience and I had to ask for extra everything because she'd only put a tiny bit of everything on the sandwich. Neither one could seem to understand me or communicate well in English. By the end, I was just pissy. I will not be returning."
"38|1|Solid, and one of the least disastrous Subway shops I've been to, as I find that so many of these sandwich ""artists"" can abuse and misuse the ingredients that more often than not give the whole franchise a bad name, and take this from someone who worked at multiple locations over a number of years.Service is quick, although we have never been here during lunch rush, and shop is always clean and bright. One thing that irks me is the whole ""Cold Cut Combo"" thing, where it says on the menu that it comes with ""ham, salami, and bologna,"" and when I ordered it for the first time, there was no ham or salami. The worker's explanation: ""it's ham salami, not ham AND salami."" Well then somebody please tell me what in the world ""ham salami"" is...!All in all, I feel like I can come here and trust them to produce something decent, any time. I'd come back."
"39|1|This is a reliable take-out shop in the Crystal City underground. The shop is always clean and the staff are friendly. I wish that the vegetable ingredients looked a little fresher. See (for example) the picture of the spinach (with wilted bits) and onions (with spoiled brown bits). That condition for veggies is pretty typical for this shop, but not for other Subway shops in the area."
40|1|I always go to Subway with my grandpa when I visit DC - he goes on average twice a week! The owner and staff are always friendly; facility is well maintained and the quality is fresh. The mall area always has groups of folks hanging out so the ambience is lively.
"41|2|I haven't had any issues with customer service, but all the food is very small portions compared to other subways. When I get a steak and egg and cheese they give me just a thimble amount of steak"
"42|2|My co-worker found a grasshopper in his sandwich today. There were multiple witnesses. While I realize that grasshoppers are a delicacy in some parts of the world and that Subway has a ton of topping options, I don't think either scenario applies here. So why 2 stars?A. I've never found one in MY sandwiches here.B. Service is super fast (perhaps too fast to notice a grasshopper going into a sandwich??)C. The manager was very quick to respond. He refunded my colleague's money, plus gave him a new sandwich and some cookies. Perhaps some would argue that isn't enough given what happened, but at least you gotta give the guy credit for acting fast."
43|2|Ate a couple oatmeal rasin cookies here. Got Sick as a dog! Do NOT eat them as they may leave them out too long near the weekend.
"44|3|As I waited in line, I thought long and hard about what it really takes to be a sandwich artist.Long and hard.For 2 minutes.While I credit myself with the ability to have made that sandwich with a bit more finesse than the young lady that helped me, I thought:""Not everyone can be that talented.""But, my bread was fricky, fricky fresh and my soder was poppin.'"
"45|3|It's Subway so you know what kind of food you're getting and either you like it or you don't. Personally, I like the veggie or the roast beef (when it was on the $5 value menu) and I can't do the ""mystery meat"". Anyway, this Subway is clean and the staff is fast, friendly and gives you lots of food on your sandwich."
"46|3|So you want a quick and cheap sandwich? This is the place. There are three people to help guide your creation of the perfect sub. I created a variation of the Subway Melt. all the heat included toasted buns! I saw a red pepper salsa at the end of the serving line. This was just the right kick for my creation. The price was right and with a clean, large, comfortable setting... Why not? Now if there was one area to improve, it has to be the iced tea. It was fresh brewed, but it was weak and watery. There was only one dispenser, so more was obviously needed. I would give them a try if you are in the Crystal City Underground. Eat fresh!"
"47|3|I beat the lunch time rush at this subway the day after the Redskins dominated the New Orleans Saints.  Okay, so why am I referencing a football game with Subway?  Because as a result of the Redskins scoring 20 points or more, Subway / Redskins Fans can obtain a FREE 6inch subway with a purchase of a large drink and chips.  After tax its a whooping $3 and change.  So if you love the Redskins & Subway, then definitely take advantage of the promotion below:  redskins.com/fan-zone/su…It took a minute to redeem my coupon at Subway as the employee were not aware of such a promotion.  The manager swiftly trained the employees and I was off to eat my sub like RG3 to the end zone.  HTTR & Subway!"
"48|1|This is the best Subway. The staff is stable and very nice and thorough.  This guy knows his menu, stock and product details. He always asks if you want your sandwich cut and today wrapped half in foil when we said we weren't sure if we could finish it. We stop every time we're in the area."
"49|1|I love that they have the little glass that can go up and down to cover the food. I know that it is impossible to keep flies out of a restaurant, and with this glass I know that the fly is going to have to be clever to touch anything under it. This subway is very clean, and has a small sitting area with a TV to enjoy your lunch. The parking isn't that great, but it still one of the best subways I have gone to in a long time."
"50|3|Clean, new, fast, and very friendly staff. Parking is not easy, and neither is getting a sub that looks like the pictures they advertise. Free the lettuce!"
"51|1|I love this place, especially when I need something fast to eat on my lunch break at work! The Subway Melt on Honey Oat Bread is so delicious. Parking sometime can be a hassle."
"52|3|A little too crowded at lunch hour, so you have to go before or after to avoid a long line. These locations (two permanent and a cart) were pioneers with the Subway breakfast sandwiches, which are not great but actually have healthier options that any of the other fast food places in the building."
"53|1|I usually visit JBAB Bolling Exchange Food Court, while I'm on base. If I'm in a hurry, I will pay a visit to Subway. It's distracting and confusing for customers  to have the order line in close proximity to Charley's."
"54|1|Great, great, great!  I love the Subway kiosk there at the Apex between corridors 5 and 6.  The ladies there for some reason always have enough bread, enough meats, cheese, and veggies to have a sandwich for me regardless of the time of the work day.The only bad thing is that there is no toaster machine here so I have to eat my sandwiches cold.  Nothing hits the spot like a toasted BMT with provolone....mmm....."
55|3|The steak sandwich is my favorite for lunch once a week. The staff are nice here at my work location in Crystal city. Subway Tuesdays are delicious.
"56|2|I went to buy three sandwiches on this subway and ordered two 6-inch tuna and one 12-inch meatballs.  The tuna ones were prepared well for me, but the meatballs gave me 5 meatloaf with enough sauce and the others without any sauce, which disgusted me.  However, I let it pass and asked for cheddar cheese and when I saw that they added very little to my sandwich, I thought that oor favir they would add a little more cheese and Silvia replied that that could not be, that she gave me the exact measurement,  As far as I know legally, a measurement is not done by hand but by a meter.  In view of that, I decided not to take my sandwich and stay with the desire to eat.  It is a sacred hour, lunch time, where the client goes to fast conidas for not having time to cook, so that someone like Mrs. Silvia comes to embitter the clients' lunch time.  It is my first time that I visit this subway and I assure you that it will be the last time until they change Mrs. Silvia because I do not want to have a bad experience in that place again due to the ineptitude of her staff, as is the case with the lady.  Silvia, which caused a severe headache and high blood pressure.  I recommend no one to go to this subI went to buy three sandwiches on this subway and ordered two 6-inch tuna and one 12-inch meatballs.  The tuna ones were prepared well for me, but the meatballs gave me 5 meatloaf with enough sauce and the others without any sauce, which disgusted me.  However, I let it pass and asked for cheddar cheese and when I saw that they added very little to my sandwich, I thought that oor favir they would add a little more cheese and Silvia replied that that could not be, that she gave me the exact measurement,  As far as I know legally, a measurement is not done by hand but by a meter.  In view of that, I decided not to take my sandwich and stay with the desire to eat.  It is a sacred hour, lunch time, where the client goes to fast conidas for not having time to cook, so that someone like Mrs. Silvia comes to embitter the clients' lunch time.  It is my first time that I visit this subway and I assure you that it will be the last time until they change Mrs. Silvia because I do not want to have a bad experience in that place again due to the ineptitude of her staff, as is the case with the lady.  Silvia, which caused a severe headache and high blood pressure.  I recommend no one to go to this subway.Also I sent an email to the owner of the Subway restaurant and I spoke with him by phone and he told me that he was going to decide for me to go to the restaurant to get my sandwich again and it's almost 6:00 pm and I still haven't had lunch  .  Now I understand why his employee, Mrs. Silvia, acted that way, what a real shame.  but I will never go to that restaurant and I do not admit it to anyone."
"57|1|This is one of the better Subway shops I have been to, and I have been to my fair share. I haven't yet dined in but the store looks inviting in and outside, ingredients have not been abused like at some other Subway restaurants, and I appreciate parking right in front of the store most of the time. Their sandwiches? Unlike at many other shops, I haven't yet had the displeasure of returning my sub because of stale bread, and the most recent tuna sub was on point, with the recommended honey mustard I found perfect for tuna. I've only ever tried sweet chilli sauce on tuna since customers recommended it when I worked at Subway shops in Australia, but since they don't seem to have sweet chilli here, I'm glad I've found a decent alternative. I've only had this same lady -Orfilia?- for service, and she's always been reasonably friendly and quick, so no issues there. They close at 10pm most of the week except for Sunday night -9pm-, I sometimes miss it because I get there right around 9pm. I'd recommend this shop, and definitely go back."
"58|2|Got here the sign in on it's not 9, but guess what they decided to close! Best service especially when you don't even get to experience it!"
59|2|Wow came in here once and the line was very long with only ONE person there. This poor woman kept calling in the back for help and the woman kept ignoring her and kept opening boxes instead of helping at the register.
"60|3|I went in here tonight it was around 8:30-8:45ish and I stood in the store for atleast 10 mins before anyone knew I was there. While I was waiting the line looked very unkempt. The cutting boards were not out and there was lettuce everywhere and it just looked like the they were cleaning, but stopped midway. I also notice the steam table that  had the meatballs in it wasn't steaming at all, there was actually barely any water in it. Finally one boy noticed me and he told another guy to grab me because he was dealing with the trash and ending up mopping the floor. Which was another concern because when he came to mop he never put out the wet floor sign so whomever came in could have slipped. The gentlemen that helped me seemed nice, but I couldn't here a word he was saying despite me being the only person in the store. I thought maybe he's sick or something, but seemed like he could talk when it came to his coworker. I still got my food and it was delicious, but I don't think I will come back to this location again because of the customer service being way to slow for me. While I ate my sandwich I felt a little hurried because the guy mopping the floor was waiting to mop where I was. Three other people had entered the store while I was there and every time they had to wait because the boy mopping the floor had to keep going to he back to get the other man every time. Despite the derive I gave it three stars because my sandwich was still good."
61|2|This review is about the service not the food. Walked in last evening. I was the only customer in there at the time. One person was at the register and another with his back turned. No one acknowledged I was even there. Finally the person at the register called in the back and says customer. It should not take several minutes to say something to the customer when no one else is there.
"62|2|Pretty dissapointing at this location. I decided on the ruben, and had a sandwich with the bread not toasted, meat was cold after biting into it and cheese only partially melted. If you want a real sandwich go to the end of the corner to the diner and they will serve you a proper sandwich. For 7 bucks you can do much better than be disappointed here. I am not the kind of person to take my sandwich back and ask for a redue ,but this is one occasion I should have."
"63|2|It's a Subway, so the food is standard. But I've never been to a restaurant before that declined to offer something so simple as an extra disposable salad bowl because they ""have to count everything"". You'd think a franchisee would recognize that long term repeat business is more important than a 5 cent product! Since the Ballston Mall Subway has better service and friendlier employees, I'd encourage you to take your business over there!"
"64|2|Rude service- gave me a dirty look when I asked for utensils and napkins.  ""Fresh"", yeah right. My lettuce was practically yellow. Don't want to waste more time even writing a review."
"65|2|This place was so bad that I came back from a 2 year hiatus of posting reviews just to try to warn people not to come here.I have never experienced such general apathy from food prep staff as I have at this Subway.  The employees, scowling throughout the manufacture of my sandwich and those before and after me, were literally throwing the food onto the sandwiches and back into the bins, with stray vegetables flying everywhere.  And this wasn't just one person, this was the whole assembly line of disgruntled employees.  I was amazed at how rude they were, and will never be going back.  At least at the one around the corner, they are tolerable."
66|1|Nice location that has never gotten crowded when I have been there (this also counts for lunch time).  The sandwich artists are really nice and are efficient when getting your order done.  The only thing I was not a fan of was this locations lack of guacamole :(.  Other than this is my favorite location to slide to when I want a fast veggie sub!
"67|3|I usually don't get out of my office but the other day I was craving Subway so I had to! I love this place and I get the same thing every single time. The only reason I did not give them a full 5 star is because the actual location is very small and compact which makes it hard to move around in the actual facility. Also, there is not a wide variety of drinks here as my coworker just wanted regular tea. As Subway is known to be advertised for eating healthy I will say we need more healthy in the actual place! Healthy drinks included. Also, the soup machine never seems to work here."
"68|2|If I could rate zero, I would. Young girl, Clarysa, has a serious attitude and I generally check that kind of behavior but u was with my husband and didn't want to upset him. Her demeanor appeared racist. She had her nose turned up while making my sandwich. She threw the cheese back in the container. Threw the toppings on the sandwich. I asked for riper tomatoes and she challenged me that all were about the same. Two other black ladies came in and were at the counter to buy cookies, I looked at Clarysa and she had her nose turned up while staring at them in which she had no interaction with them.Young white guy was getting a sandwich made and I didn't see that same expression on her face. May be she just didn't want to be at work... not sure but as a retired military officer and doctorate level professional on vacation in the area, if I had not been with my husband, I would not have tolerated that behavior and certainly would not have given them my business. So for others visiting, don't patronize or tolerate this behavior. Nasty, rude and ignorant girl!"
69|2|I generally like subway but being ignored in favor of a customer behind me in line and being treated poorly after calling attention to the issue is unacceptable.
"70|2|I went to this location at around 9:15 as I wanted to grab a familiar bite to eat before heading home. There were 3 ladies in there cleaning up the stands at that time. I appreciated that because I like a nice clean store. The first girl to greet me was nice and politely smiled at me as I told her I needed to take a look at the menu. Then the girl that proceeded to make my food was grumpy all the way. She asked if I was ready to order after I told the First Lady I was not be she had a rude attitude. Normally I would leave a store that had a rude worker but I was too hungry to find something else that was over my price range. We decided to eat in the store since nothing else was opened that had tablespoons the whole time we were eating we got rude stares and heard them talking in a different language and snickering while looking at us. I proceeded to ignore them then we ended up finishing 15 minutes before closing. As we were cleaning up, there was a group of younger people that came in to place an order and they got the same treatment as well. I see that this place has terrible ratings and that should not be the case for the national harbor. They should have class and be polite to their customers but nothing seems to be changing at this location."
"71|2|This has to be the worst subway I've ever been to, it was 8:40 pm and I walked in to buy a sub and the worker said they're closed. Don't ever go to a store in Maryland, they have the most laziest workers in the country. Won't be returning to this subway EVER AGAIN!"
72|2|I called 311 and asked to have the health inspection. I will not go into details but bad enough.  If I list them here they may fix it just for the inspectors. The need to just close or get new management.
"73|2|The manager exchanged emails with me saying that these two ladies were formally counselled and put on 90 days probation.  I hope that improves their performance on the job, and that no one else has to go through what I did there.  And of the many lessons that can be drawn from this, I hope the ones they take away are the most positive ones."
"74|1|Great service with a smile & the new wraps are delicious! My favorite is the rotisserie chicken & Caesar salad. I add a bit of chipotle sauce to it & have that at least 3 times a week! Highly recommend this location, selection & staff!"
"75|2|This place is the worst subway location in VA. This place is FILTHY!!!You would assume that if they are wearing gloves and preparing your sandwich that it would be clean... Well, not here. I came home and opened up my tuna foot long sandwich.... there was an inch of curly black hair on the first half of my sandwich!!! How is that possible??? Exactly, this place is dirty- this hair; it must have been in the olives or vegetables because the curly hair was found at the very top of the sandwich. It doesn't end there. I decided to toss out my first half, and as I'm reaching for the other half which I assume was NOT infected, BEHOLD: ANOTHER CURLY HAIR!!! This time, it was on the outside of the sandwich on the wrapper! THIS IS BEYOND DISGUSTING. I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS ABOUT TO EAT THE 2ND HALF THAT I ASSUME WAS CLEAN. I am assuming the employee who was helping me had long arm hairs and was shedding onto the sandwich ? THIS IS BEYOND DISGUSTING. I WOULD NEVER RETURN TO THIS DIRTY LOCATION, AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GUYS GOING ANOTHER SUB PLACE THAT HOLDS CLEANLINESS AS A PRIORITY."
"76|2|How I heard of this place: Wow. If anyone can remember where and when they first heard of Subway, post a comment below. I sure am at a loss for when I first walked into a Subway franchise.Type of cuisine: Fast, healthy food by way of easy-to-prepare sandwiches, made to order - right in front of the customer - using freshly baked breads, select sauces and a variety of fresh, delicious toppings.Ambiance: This Subway location, similar to other Subway's, but found in the Ballston Common mall food court, has a kiosk set-up with yellow tones, plastic and laminate, food court seating and an order counter with the toppings for each sandwich in plain view behind the plexi-glass window panel.What I ordered: My husband ordered a foot-long Oven Crisp Chicken sandwich ($5.50) on whole wheat bread.  He added lettuce, tomato, onion, green bell peppers, and a chipotle-ranch sauce. In the mood for a salad, I turned the Turkey Avocado sandwich ($5.50) into a salad (additional $0.75 for one scoop of avocado): with shredded lettuce, tomato, green bell peppers, red onion, olives, sliced pepperoncinis, two strips of bacon, a small ice cream scoop of squished avocado and chicken instead of turkey, topped with a honey-mustard dressing.What I loved: Easily accessible, convenient location and a quick, relatively inexpensive take-out dinner.Why I loved it: I loved sharing our first meal, together, as husband and wife in our new apartment!Cost: Low to average ($5-$8 per sandwich/salad)"
77|2|I've only eaten there one time and I got food poisoning. I'm sure it doesn't happen every time but buyer beware.
"78|1|Ordered Italian herbs n cheese, with tuna. Bread was soo soft. Double toasted. Very tasty. Environment clean. Restrooms closed."
"79|2|Some of the lettuce was brown, the amounts of some toppings given were small, and the staff was apathetic/just not into it"
"80|1|So, it's a Subway. Nothing new here, but the service here is AWESOME compared to other Subways I've been to. Sweet sandwich maker lady, thank you for starting my day off on the right foot :)"
"81|2|I have no complaints with the location as far cleanliness but the service was not the best.  I had presented them with a coupon I had received in the mail and they gave me the harest time about it.  The man looked at it, read it up and down and when he finally issued me the discount he made a rude comment.  It's close to where I live but I'd rather walk a few more blocks to one closer to the Ballston Metro."
"82|1|I frequent this location (just got us some sandwiches last night) mainly because it's conveniently close to where I reside... but I have to say that the food has never been terrible, always pretty fresh, the inside is always clean & the service is usually pretty decent!  TRUST me if they lacked in ANY of those aforementioned characteristics I'd definitely stop eating there, I'm known for going the distance for quality service and food/items.Just my opinion... Though the surrounding area of where this is located does need a lot of clean up/work & it will probably deter you from wanting to try it out... but I see a lot of things changing around there soon due to the upcoming growth that is happening a few blocks away (at the National Harbor), so maybe that will help businesses in the area get the support they deserve."
83|2|Terrible hair found in my sisters food. Called to speak to manager and they are very unprofessional. I do not recommend stay away
"84|3|This was your typical Subway location. The visit was normal, nothing stood out beyond the clear attitude displayed from the employees. I probably would not visit again."
85|2|If i could give this place no stars i would. I legit hate coming here- it's just very close to my parents house. I came here for a tuna sub. They limit their portions by allllllll means. I watch the man (whom i hate when he makes my sandwiches) take four tiny scoops that equal up to one scoop and spread it across my sandwich. I could still see the bottom of the bread. I said can you put a little more on there? He said .75. I told him i def was NOT paying .75 Bc that's the appropriate amount it should be. He argued me down. I turned around and left! Then he tried to say OKAY OKAY- I'll do it. By that time i was out the door. These ppl will cheat you out your portions. This has been on more than one occasion I've came here. I will NEVER return.
86|1|This is the best subway I honestly have ever been too. The employees and management are extremely personable and friendly. They remember my girlfriend and I every time we come in and are always exceptional with how they prepare the food and with their service. Well earned 5 stars!
87|2|Food is good but the customer service is not. To continue to talk in another language while you are serving someone makes it difficult for you to hear them. Talking to your coworker is fine but when a customer is ordering it's good to respect and listen to that person.
"88|1|This subway wasn't bad at all. It's in the hood but the people servicing me were very nice and engaging. They listened to what I wanted and didn't rush me. The only reason I give this Subway 4 stars and not 5 was because I felt guilty and uncomfortable when I was approached by a guy to buy him a sandwich. I didn't have any extra money to buy him lunch.I just wanted to mind my business, grab a bite to each and go back to work. I know everyone needs a little help every now and then but sometimes I get irritated when I just want to be left alone."
"89|1|Great food at a reasonable price! Folks, the tuna is REAL tuna. Do not hesitate to order the tuna sub as you will not be disappointed! Subway has never, ever used fake tuna. My tastebuds know the difference as I have eaten vegan tuna before. Subway's tuna sub is wonderful. They add lots of great veggies to your sub for no additional cost! A very healthy lunch choice to keep you full during your workday. :)"
"90|2|My coworker and I received Subway gift cards from our principal and wanted to use them after getting pedicures at a nearby shop. We entered the shop at 7:55 and waited for the store associate to finish helping other people. Before she took my order, she said they were closed and complained about us coming in the store. She continued to have an attitude the entire time. She was very respectful to the teenagers ordering in front of us and took extra time to provide great customer service. She did not ask my friend for her order and started putting up the food while my sandwich was in the oven. My friend asked her several times if she could place an order and she ignored it. I finally had to tell the associate that my friend wanted to order. My friend didn't even want a sandwich just cookies. The store associate continued to ignore her completely. My order total was 8.86 and my gift card was for 5.00. She did not want us to use the gift cards and we tried to scan them several times. I indicated that you could type in the code and she refused. Instead of asking if I wanted to use another payment method, she placed the food behind the glass with her hand guarding it and started rambling about the store being closed. I had three other cards I could have used but we just left the food because of her attitude. Another woman came in the store while we were leaving. She told that women that they were closed but offered to help her anyway and started making small talk. From the time we entered to store to the time we left, the experience was one of the worst I've had at a subway or similar restaurant. We had gift cards from our principal who urged us to use them soon and this store was the closest. I don't even want to use the gift cards anymore or visit another subway. Before teaching, I worked in various customer service jobs. Nasrin's service and attitude was completely unacceptable."
91|1|This is a great subway all the employees are nice the food is fresh and comes fast. This is a great place to eat.
"92|1|Some days I just need a quick meal and do not have time to travel far from home.  The bread, meat and toppings are always fresh; the employees are always friendly even when the store is busy."
"93|2|I am a Subway fan but it's unfortunate that the location closest to my house is the worst Subway establishment in the Continental United States. The place is not overly messy or anything like that but, as everyone has already said, the customer service is TERRIBLE. The woman who works there barely talks and scowls as she makes the sandwiches. The man/owner is a HUGE jerk. 80% of the time his eyes are as red as a firetruck and he sits in the back and text. IF he decides to get up to help the customers he lets it be known that you are inconveniencing him. I've personally seen him get in verbal altercations with 2 different patrons. It's just a really really terrible location. Clarendon deserves better."
"94|2|0 STARS If you're looking for a subway that has trash on the floor, unclean tables, rude customer service, and hair in your food this is your place!!!"
95|2|I was in a bind for something quick and easy.  The guy who works here is super unfriendly and totally skimps on the meat and toppings on your sub.  This is probably the worst location of subway that I've ever visited.
96|2|The absolute worst. All of the reviews are true. The customer service is absolutely terrible. I asked how this woman how she was and she literally groaned and wouldn't speak. No eye contact. No smile. Everything looks dirty and the entire experience is overall unpleasant to say the least.And there is a good one walking distance away. It isn't like this is the only choice guys lets just stop going.
97|2|** WORST Customer Service Worker / Franchise location EVER **#1 - RUDEST worker (same guy in the picture in the previous review) - never says hello#2 - UNPROFESSIONAL worker (same guy) - never smiles#3 - UNFRIENDLIEST worker (same guy) - never speaks up - looks mean ALL the time#4 - Ahhh you get the point.Possible reasons why this place and/or worker is still there:#1 - The worker is a relative or friend of the owner#2 - Its the ONLY Subway in that area#3 - See #1#4 - See #2
98|2|Worst subway ever! The guy was unpleasant to talk to and acted like I owed a favor by getting his attention and after looking at my credit card realized he over charged me! Never going back to this location and will be contacting corporate to let them know this is really leaving a bad impact on the brand.
99|2|Meh. Subway is subway but the workers is what makes it good or bad. I went in to get lunch because they're generally quick. Sandwich making process was fine but once I get to the counter I encounter someone that's talking on the phone. She continues to talk as if I wasn't standing there. After a few minutes of listening to her have a conversation I interrupt her and ask if I could pay. She proceeds to walk into the back making me want to just take my food and leave. She comes back and says there is a big shipment and her boss is on the phone. I'm sure he would've understand being put on hold for a customer. But I guess I'm not that important to halt a phone call for 3o seconds to take my money. Most likely never to return to this spot.
"100|2|The people here neither speak nor understand English. All they know how to say is, Would you like a drink with that? When a problem arises with the register, they're clueless. And you have to ask for napkins; they don't provide them. No wonder the owner was recently indicted for tax fraud."
"101|2|I won't comment on the food because Subway generally tastes the same.However, the morning staff is consistently surly- barely a word out of them. I know that not everyone is a morning person, but they should remember to be reasonably nice to customers."
"102|2|The employee mopped the floor; and then came out to take care of customers without washing her hands.  Putting on plastic gloves helps, I suppose; the Va Food Handler's rule is that they should wash hands anytime doing any cleaning before preparing food."
"103|1|Jared would be proud. Clean, fast service, ample seating. Pretty standard Subway otherwise."
"104|1|Clean, good portions, fresh ingredients, and polite staff. The store looks like any other subway locations but I think what makes this location exceptional is the quality of the food you get and the friendly staff. Made me start going to Subway more often."
"105|3|Of all the subways I have been to, this is the most disorganized facility ever. I ordered salad online and half of the veggies from my salad was missing as well the sauce. They didn't bother giving me a fork and said they don't carry croutons usually given out with subway salad."
"106|1|Outside needs work, but lots of room inside. No fountain machine, but they sell soda and water in a bottle. Inside was a little dirty, but food appeared fresh. Ate there three days in a row for lunch since it was close to Hilton hotel. Got three different sandwiches each time and all were good."
"107|2|Rolled up here for a quick subway ""sub"", key word being ""SUB"", annnnnnd they seriously had NO sub bread left, only flatbread. That's like goin to the movie theatre and they are like,""oh sorry we aren't playing any movies."" So yea, not much else to say. However, they earned 1 extra star for giving us free cookies."
108|1|the other reviewer is out of his mind.  i have been coming to this location regularly for a couple years and the service here is amazing.   the staff is VERY friendly to the point where i know a bit about many of the workers and they make an effort to remember my order.  I am not unique in this sense as i see them warmly greet a number of other people as well.   many of the workers have been with the company for a few years and are highly skilled sandwich artists.  I also learned that the quincy street location is under the same management as the this one and one of the workers bounces between the two places.  i used to frequent the quincy street location as well and had a similar experience.   when the quincy street worker started at the fairfax one it was as if i had seen an old friend.   i give this place 5 stars not because the food is amazing but because this subway is probably the best i have ever been to.
"109|1|This place is great.  The manager there is a lovely lady named Angie - she has been there since this location opened.  They have the best tuna - yes I am aware everything is prepackaged but for some reason this tuna has a very distinctive taste and texture.  Bread and toppings are always fresh and delicious.During lunch this place works like an assembly line, I'm talking real assembly line circa early 1900's.  I like this location better than the one on Sacramento and the one near Huntington Metro Station.  A 6 inch sub always fills me up and I keep the other 6 inches for the following day or my next meal.  I appreciate the friendly employees - if they have a guest that isn't well versed in the English language they have a way of communicating with them without embarrassing them.  In my book that's awesome customer service!"
110|2|Zero stars!!! They put ingredients on my sandwich I purposely removed from my online order because I'm allergic. Now I've eaten some of it and will be sick!! Do not come or order from here!
"111|2|Great food, clean place, shit service. First of all, there were three people there... One behind the register, one on meat, one on add ons. Sounds good, right? Well, dude on meat decides that it is time to play around with bread dough (not even putting it in the oven, literally just taking the raw dough that is on the tray, stretching it, spraying something on it, and putting it back on the cart). I looked at the time... This genius did this for SEVEN MINUTES. Oh, and I think he was the manager. The add on lady disappeared, so the guy in front if me had his toasted sandwich getting all cold and sitting there for seven minutes. By the way, this whole time, there are at least 50 loaves of finished bread in the warmer... It wasn't an emergency. So, finally he makes my sandwiches, everything is fine, I get to the register, and this rude woman begins her nonsense. I had a coupon that said buy one sub and any drink, get one free. I have a family friend's little kid at home, so I decide on the Honest Kids juice box as my drink. You would have thought I was trying to circumnavigate the Geneva Convention. ""UMM, THIS COUPON OF YOURS SAYS YOU HAVE TO GET A LARGE FOUNTAIN DRINK, MA'AM."" I calmly say, ""actually, it says any drink."". She rolls her eyes and goes, ""no! A fountain drink! You can't just get this. You have to get the other one."" We go back and forth, I didn't raise my voice once because I knew I was going to call corporate anyway... I just wanted my sandwich... Well now she starts talking to Bread Dough  and interrupting his busy playing with raw dough time, and she says, ""this woman wants the cheap juice with her coupon. She needs to get a fountain drink."" Dough Warrior goes, ""um, give it to her. The coupon says any drink..."" She shoots me a nasty look and says, ""fine! I'll give it to you"". #1) don't clutter my mailbox with coupons if your employees have a hard time reading or an attitude problem. I can pay the $5 for an extra sandwich. Calm down. #2) you don't take 7 minutes doing God knows what when you have three customers waiting. You can do all of our sandwiches in 2 minutes since all you have to do is slice them and meat them and send them off... Come on. #3) It's been a few hours and I'm not sick, so the food is fine... And the veggies looked freshly cut and the place was clean, unlike a certain other subway down the road... But for heavens sakes, get yourselves together."
"112|1|Subway is Subway - I enjoyed my sandwich, which was just what I ordered.  The only problem we had is that we ordered cookies, and paid for them, but when we arrived at our destination to eat our sandwiches - we discovered that we left without the cookies.  Now why didn't the cashier get our attention before we left the establishment?"
"113|2|This Subway has gone way downhill lately. They skimp SO much on the veggies they put on your sub, it's almost comical. I have literally 4 spinach leaves and 3 slices of tomato in my footlong. It's a fight to get the server to add more, even after we specifically ask ""could you please put in some more?"", they'll hesitantly add in ONE more leaf. It's been this way the last several times we have been here. The sandwiches are skinny and lacking in produce, and the wait time is unreasonably long in the mornings, with lots of customers lining up for breakfast and only one person making sandwiches. We'll be going to the Subway down the street from now on. No more sad, dry sandwiches."
"114|1|Standard subway but they move fast, nice employees, and all the food is fresh. Parking is a bit rough, easier to go to the parking lot just adjacent. They always do a good job marking the subs with differences when you have several. They fill the subs with a solid amount of toppings, even for foot longs which I feel like most don't. Solid location for a chain."
"115|1|Very good Subway, food is good!! People are nice.  Service is fast. Never had a problem here!!! I like this location!!!"
116|2|I hate to do this...but I frequent this subway for many years.   I love the tuna.  When I took the first bite....I thought it was piece of an onion....it was a long piece of hair.  I was totally sick the whole day.  Although I did speak to the manager...Angie...she was kind and nice.....she offered me another sub...but I just can't think about eating there anymore b/c of that once piece of long hair.  Please...love you much but wear a hair net.  Sorry...love the people but not the food any longer.  Good luck :)
"117|1|it's your standard subway restaurant with the same food. i was in and out in under 5 minutes, even though there was a line."
"118|1|Nate, was amazing, came in for a regular pizza, and went out of the way, cutting my tomatoes , My jalapeño just right, was supper friendly, polite, definitely recommend this location..  great Job Nate"
"119|2|I ordered two wraps online and paid for them so I could do the grab and go covid public distance pick up!! I was given a time for pickup and showed up a few minutes after to give a lil extra time. When I went into pick up my order at the ""express lane established just for rona"" I was told it would be a few minutes as they had not made my wraps? Not sure why online grab n go ordering is even a thing as you have to wait anyway?! So I received your order and when I got home there was no receipt in the bag to do their online survey?! The wrap was ok except for the fact that all the steak was on one half and the other half wasJust wrap!! This is the reason I only do Subway about every other year!! See you in 2022? Maybe!!"
120|1|This Subway Restaurant is always consistent and friendly. I ordered online and the sandwiches were ready at the appropriate time. And they were delicious.
121|2|Went later in the evening. Ran out of wheat bread. By wheat. I mean the dark bread that tastes like air. I only come here when forced by my daughter an always regret it.
"122|3|The restaurant was fast in servicing me. The portions they give are very nicely sized. For some reason it seemed like the taste wasn't the same as most subways I've been to and I always order the same thing. I had spinach in my sub even though I didn't ask for it? Thankfully it wasn't something I couldn't eat. Also, I asked for extra toasted and received half my sub burnt. Normally extra toasted is what I ask for because just toasted means the sub will still be soft and not crisp but asking it here made the right side black. Overall not bad, but i hoped for better."
"123|2|All subways are not the same!!!  First, you cannot understand a word they speak.  An interpreter would be helpful.  Second, there is no personality involved in filling your order whatsoever.  The people who work here have no interaction with you.  In fact, after you successfully order your sub, the attendants stand in front of the vegetables and condiments that you add onto your sandwich and say one word...""and"".  It is hard enough to understand what is being said, now you have to know their ordering process.  I try not to go here.  I would rather buy from a business that appreciates their customers."
"124|1|Not so bad, a run of the mill subway, but it seems to be a bit smaller on the inside. Sometimes the wait is long if it is a busy time because they only have two people working when they really should have 3 (or at least all the times I have been there). Generally clean with clean bathrooms. I have been here a number of times and it's not fantastic, but it is your typically small subway. I would recommend putting a third person on staff during busy times."
125|2|Slowest subwayin town . Pick another location.    30min in line and still havent ordered.  3 people werein front of me.
"126|2|The restaurant is very clean. However, the whole reason we went there was because we live close by and got coupons in the mail.  We were told that location does not accept coupons and it was a decision by the owner.  I don't think Subways should get to choose, especially when they send the coupons out to the neighborhood.  Disappointed, for sure.  We left and went to the one on Shiplett and they accepted the coupon."
"127|1|I came into this restaurant right in time, because I was dying of hunger, and three other customers walked in at the same time.  There were only two people sitting down and eating, and it took no time for me to place my sandwich order.  Surprisingly, this restaurant chain has kept their prices pretty reasonable, compared with some of the other sandwich shops in town.  I went for the foot long meatball marinara with provolone cheese.  I had asked for Italian bread, and they already had it baked right up. Fresh! My toppings included lettuce, tomatoes, black olives (love em), and those red bell peppers.  The sub was toasted, and it was down rite delicious!  The foot long sub, along with a fountain drink came out to be less than $10.00!  I loved it!"
128|2|I ordered 6 subs for my co workers and a women who I believe is the owner told me that I was interrupting her normal business. Excuse me how dare you? Am I not a normal customer. I come all the time but never will again. I know subway is hurting and you all cannot afford to be so rude. On top of that I called the other day and asked if I needed to order ahead of time  for that many was told no it was not necessary. Terrible- any good review on here is fake and them leaving it
"129|1|Great job to the young lady behind the counter! Greets you with a smile, very pleasant and great customer service! Even when busy she took the time to ask and say thank you for my business!! Will definitely be back!!"
"130|2|Please store your mayonnaise better. I think I just cracked the basin of my toilet bowl after five hours of extreme pain. Ate a foot long, but lost five pounds......I guess subway sandwiches are diet food"
"131|3|Foods normal for subway.  But, if you like unsweetened ice tea, avoid 6pm to closing. They are usually out and won't make more ""because they are close to closing..."".They've even run out at lunch. I mention it, and they nod, then a half hour later, there's still none. Don't usually go here anymore as it seems to be a systemic problem!"
132|1|Easily the most pleasant fast food experience I've had in the last year. It's a standard Subway with standard choices but the difference here is the staff. They work quickly and are extremely pleasant to deal with. You'd be surprised how big of a difference it makes when everyone in the place has a smile on their face. I've been a few times to this location and each time it's been the same experience.
133|1|Awesome place! The service is really good! This is my Subway in Annandale. Always clean and well kept!!  Recommended!!
134|1|I went there and they were training a new staff member. They were being so professional and patient. I love seeing people treat their own that way. Everything was very orderly and neat. My order came out perfect. Fantastic experience.
"135|1|Great service, I go here all the time and I can't stress how well done everything is! They do the job and they do the job right. The only concern I have is they often over toast my sub but it's nothing far too important. I recommend going here between breakfast time and 4, after that things get far too crowded."
"136|3|Generally OK with this location but I have to call bs on the avocado charges. Not that they are charging extra but that a couple times now, I've ordered a six inch, so that is one small scoop of avocado for 75¢. Then another time I order a footlong... One small scoop of avocado for $1.50. So am I being charged double for the same amount of avocado because they have to spend it over a bigger piece of bread? Not cool subway."
"137|1|Super nice manager at this store. Of course, it's the usual subway food, but apparently this store's pretty popular. There was a long line for me to order my breakfast sandwich, so when it came time to pay, the manager gave me a free cookie. Also great at this location: I got breakfast later than the advertised time of 11 AM (and that's standard at the Crystal City location, too). Last but not least, the bathroom was squeaky clean, which is always a good sign."
138|1|Did a catering event for our company.  Placed the order online and talked to the manager in person.  Patrick was awesome and provided great customer service.  They delivered right on time and even brought extra veggie subs in case we had any vegetarians.  Will definitely use this location again.  Catering prices can't be beat.
"139|2|Subway is pretty crappy as is, so I wasn't expecting anything amazing in the first place. The food here was pretty horrible and I couldn't even finish my other half of my sandwich (and i'm like the queen of pigs). I had a pretty upset stomach later as well. Did not ask if i wanted my sandwich toasted & seemed to struggle with keeping up with the few things I wanted on the sandwich. Go to earls instead or pack your own lunch!"
"140|3|The counter man, working alone at noon on a Saturday, struggled a bit to keep up but was nonetheless efficient and polite.  The foot-long meatball marinara sub on a fresh, toasted roll was a lot of food for six bucks, but the meatballs weren't very tasty.  I think they had a bit too much filler in them.  Next time I think I'll go with the chicken breast."
141|1|It's Subway! It's a little hard to park in there but it's pretty good. I always had good service and a good place to get a quick bite. I have seen the police frequently visit there so obviously they aren't running drug sales or putting guns in your subs so you know it's safe! This is a short review because it's Subway but it deserves something. Side comment: tables aren't always clean but what do you expect
142|2|The only subway in the DMV area that does not have a chopped salad option. Food didn't seem too fresh either. Rude staff.
"143|2|GOOD:Fresh vegetables, good service and clean place. BAD:Like all Subways, they put very little cold cuts on the sandwich."
"144|2|I am huge fan of subway but this particular one, has to be the grosses , disgusting one in the subway franchise. I ordered from them thru Door Dash, as received my sandwiches I can smell  something strong like bad BO,  emanating from my order. I first I thought i know i added extra red onions but onions do not smell like as I open all the sandwiches they all contain onions that were not edible and smelled disgusting. I can't believe that the subway sandwich did not smell that order nor did the Door dash delivery employee, the funny thing he actually thought it really bad BO. Anyway you have been warned, eat at your own risk."
145|1|Parking is tricky but this subway has great service. There were about 8 people in line when I arrived for lunch around 12:45 on a weekday. I ordered and my food was ready in 5 minutes!
"146|3|If you been to a Subway you been to them all. I actually frequent this particular location by my job because of convience. They can get really busy during the lunch rush, but they get you in and out real quick. The service is really nice and they become real familiar with the regulars real quick."
"147|2|When I went in the staff was incredibly rude to me and got all upset when I made my order just like a menu item, told me it would be extra for the same items."
"148|2|Once it gets later, you better ask what things they are out of. First I ordered a turkey, bacon, avacado, only to find out after they made the sandwich that their out of avacado. Then I ordered a chicken, ranch, bacon melt only to find out they're out of ranch, again after they made the sandwich."
"149|2|This is my husband's review.Very bad customer service,  very rude cashier(staff).March 6,2020 @10:20pmCloses 11:00pm but looks like they're about to close because they already kept half of their stuff.I nicely ask for a foot long wheat bread, he asked me what meat I politely answered plain chicken, he asked me again like he was pissed I answered again politely. He asked me again ""which one, teriyaki chicken? this one or this one?  ""  I politely answered again""plain chicken, the regular one"", he rudely asked me again and showed me he was pissed ""MAN which one?"" that's where I lose my appetite.Btw, I love they're sandwiches that's why I was surprised I was treated and experienced like that. Smh.I also watched this guy badly treated the customer before me."
"150|2|Last evening the staff was informed the fountain soda was flat, the employee took 45 minutes to figure it out. Then, today, a different employee wouldn't make something that wasn't on the kids menu. Every subway I have ever been to would have allowed it. I didn't argue because they could have charged more to satisfy a customer, they chose otherwise. I can imagine the only reason these people are still employed is because of the lack of competition in the hospital. If I managed or owned I would consider a new staff."
"151|1|Normally I don't write fast food reviews.  However, this Subway has really turned around over the last few months.  The staff is phenomenal and the food has improved.  They also have online ordering now, which saved me some time when I visited during a dinner rush.  Last I checked, they also occasionally deliver, although I haven't used that service.So, kudos to this Subway.  It really seems like they're trying to make their location a nicer place and I appreciate that."
152|2|Rahman is the worst sandwich maker ever. Plus half the ingredients look really old and it's only 1030 am. Will not come back to this location for a while!!!
"153|1|I've been coming to this subway for years and it's one of the best around Springfield. Quick and prompt service and it's decently quiet which makes it a great place to also sit in. They take coupons without much fuss and the bread tastes fresh like it should. Compared to other Subways in Springfield, this one is really good. This Subway needs to work on cleanliness and professionalism, until then they won't get five stars. If you're around the area, give it a try. There's an abundance of parking, so that's not a issue. Also it's located right across from Springfield Town Center which is convenient.If you show them your Michael's receipt, you can get a FREE cookie! No other location does this."
"154|1|Finally a subway place. This is my go to spot in the mall. Avoid the food court and come here. There Subs are healthier than Quiznos and They have seafood. They now have wheat also. All subways are the same and this is no exception and I'm sure my review would be the same for other subways. Also, I just wanted to be the first to review this"
155|1|Healthy with good prices. The workers always nice. I usually eat there after I finish my workout cause I feel I eat healthy food at least. And my favorite soup is chicken noodles
156|2|Supervisor in the black shirt has the worst attitude and will roll her eyes at you. Don't eat there. There are many subways around.
157|1|This subway is definitely one of the better ones.  We will go out of our way to come here to not have to ask for more than 3 pieces of spinach or 2 tiny cucumbers.
"158|2|Not very good... for whatever reason it seems like they missed charge you everytime I go and get the same thing it rings up a little bit different. The other complaint, I'm trying to be as politically correct as possible here, is that at least half of the workers seem to not understand English. I said mustard please and she put a large handful of olives... the guy in front of me said everything except pickles and peppers the first things she grabbed was pickles. If you can't clearly understand something you should ask not just act on what you think."
"159|2|Not only did it take them ten minutes to make a simple chicken bacon ranch salad, but then I found multiple hairs in my salad. I would highly caution you against eating here. If it were possible I would give them negative star's, but yelp hasn't advanced that far."
"160|2|Management seems good, staff seems rude and are usually loudly gossiping behind the counter and look disturbed when a costumer walks up.  My simple (one topping) sandwiches are usually made incorrectly."
"161|3|I felt rushed today especially since I went in there at noon and they did not have pastrami (how do you run out of pastrami before the lunch rush?) so I was stuck trying to decide on something else that would tickle my fancy. I ended up ordering the steak sriracha w/ pepper jack cheese, mayo, spinach, onions, olives, salt, pepper & oregano on flat bread....it was missing oil & vinegar but I guess by me making it a combo I was able to get salt & vinegar chips which satisfied that taste.  I was surprised for feeling rushed I made a good choice; I would order again if the need arises."
"162|2|I chose this particular location due to its proximity to my hotel and the Rosslyn Metro stop.  That's where the convenience of this place ended. I walked in trying to get a quick meal before heading into the city, and while the store was empty except for one other patron, it took several minutes to order.  The manager (?) cashier was taking a personal phone call on her headset.  Apparently whatever was going on in her personal life was more important than making money or assisting a customer.  She was leaning back against a cabinet and continued talking even after seeing me approach to order.  The other worker just stood there waiting for any sort of instruction.  I was extremely confused.  After a few moments, she took a slight pause I her conversation (never hung up) in order to ask me what I'd like.  I had to repeat my order a couple times since I'm sure whoever was in her ear was speaking just as animatedly as she was.  Once that was taken care of, the other young lady was quick to put my meal together.  I went to sit down and realized the table I was heading toward was not wiped down.  I chose a different spot, got my fountain drink and opened my food.  I'm thankful that I had the woman's personal phone call to keep me company.  I finished a foot long sub, and when I left she was still talking.  I was tempted to ask her what kind of lay-on-neck headphones she was using, because they must have an amazing battery life."
"163|2|The whole Subway franchise is inconsistent compared with most other fast food chains, as the subs and service vary so dramatically depending on the shop, and on who serves you even within the same shop! My second time at this could have been better, but basically, they used old stale honey oat bread that was so overbaked that it was blackened and rock hard with a burnt taste. I had two or three bites of my footlong ham sub, but just couldn't eat anymore so went to the checkout and told them about it. Good thing is that they apologised and made another one, but the bad thing was that even though the wheat bread they served -said they ran out of honey oat- was clearly not old, it was slightly underdone, and the end had hard bits -in the photo- sticking out, which is probably from handling, and it should not have been served as was. Places like this confuse me. Would you like your sandwich on an old bread? Then why even bother to serve it to me in the first place?"
"164|1|Clean, pleasant experience and TiaQuanna took great care in making my sandwich. I know some subways are a hit or miss but this one definitely is a HIT with TiaQuanna."
"165|2|Im not a daily customer but i come her some in a while. Services has been good before but this time It was the worst customer service I have received. I went there and order to sandwich not gonna go to detail. The guy who made my food did a good job, but at the time of paying the cashier didn't have change on my $100 bills and she also wasn't paying attention at the time of charging me because she was talking with someone else on her phone, plus she forgot to give my changed right. I hope you guys can better you customer service. (I'm not looking for any type of refund)"
166|2|Being diabetic and having tea that's marked UNSWEETENED and it's clearly SWEET is a HUGE NO NO! Not impressed or happy....
"167|2|Went to this subway at 8:43 tonight but the employees had already locked up the doors, even though it's posted that they are open until 9. Called an spoke to Tineka (sp?) who couldn't give me any reason why they were closed, not would she give me contact info for the general manager. Very unfortunate when employees take the stores operating hours into their own hands."
"168|1|Clean just after lunch time, 2pm on a weekday. 4 group tables that seat 4, 3 small tables that seat 2. Not stingy with toppings, looks fresh, well stocked with chips. Good service. That's all you really need to know for a subway. It's a healthy option in an area full of greasy fast food. No outdoor seating."
"169|2|Came around 9:40pmI say Hi and they look at me like i don't exist, ignore me and move away. ( no customers other than me)What?!After a few minutes Wanted a salad to eat in, the lady didn't  exactly know what she's doing!They  kept saying they'll close at 10pm. I said okay I get it. I will eat and leave.They locked the door. Around 9:50!Damn they are in a hurry to leave.Service was crap really."
170|2|Went to this Subway for a Turkey Reuben and they don't even carry rye bread or Swiss cheese. So I was charged for a Reuben without half of the stuff that makes it a Reuben.
171|3|I don't understand why this place is so ok.  Its in an upscale area but everyone working inside seems like that they are in the last place they want to be. I'm not a fan but its good when you need a quick fix.
"172|2|This location has the rudest staff ever. I frequent this location due to proximity to my house and regret it each time I go. I routinely have to ask for additional vegetables as their standard is literally one thread of onion and one small piece of pepper per sandwich. Although they always give extra, it is either reluctance and usually one pepper at a time. Today they were out of both tuna and seafood so I left without a sandwich. I will not return."
"173|1|I know it is just a regular subway, but the people working here are so nice I had to give them a good review.  They are very patient and hard working.  It is a clean restaurant with some outdoor seating when it is nice, and parking around back.  My elementary aged son loves to come here with his friends and the employees always talk to them and help them out."
"174|2|If you don't mind workers with attitude then  you won't mind coming here. This place defines rude. Also one worker didn't even know how to make a flatbread steak an bacon!!The service stinks but the food is good, that's why they only get two stars. I will only return to this place if my life depended on it and I was dying from food."
"175|2|Call me a glutton for punishment. I came to this Subway in SW across from Safeway last week. I was charged $9.99 for a for seafood foot long. The sandwich was great. I went back today with a coupon.  I looked at the menu and noticed that the sandwich that I had bought last week was $7.99?  Well I was happy today because I had a coupon for $7.99 for a foot-long with chips and a drink. Yippie! Right? While I'm standing in line confusion starts at the register! A lady's credit card is not working and the young person with her what appeared to have some medical issues started crying hysterically. Apparently the card belonged to her and she did not know it was not working properly. I offered to pay for her order. She had a sandwich and a soda mind you my meal was $8. He rang me up for $20 and some change. I kid you not, the lady had a 6 foot sandwich and a soda. He tells me that she had ribs (not steak), soda and chips. You've heard the old saying you screw me once shame on you, you screw me twice shame on me. The motto to this story is to pay attention to the menu and your money in this place. Oh! The tuna was terrible. Subway usually has wonderful tuna salad. Boo!!!"
176|2|This used to be my go to place for a quick sub sandwich. The covid hit and safest way to order and pay was via their app. However corporate controls the app and the pick up location is a franchisee. The app often contains discontinued menu items - you are allowed to order them - and the transaction goes through and you are charged - but then the store calls to say that they no longer offer it. No big deal but getting your money back is impossible. Store level franchisee says corporate must take care of it. Corporate customer service is a fill in form that they they never respond to. Tweeting them got a response of sorry but it is not our problem either. There are lots of restaurants hurting during covid and I have been trying to support those closest to me but being ripped off is not the way to keep a good customer.
"177|1|As far as Subways go, this was perfectly adequate. They made my order the way I asked for it, they were polite, and the tables were clean. No issues!"
"178|2|I ordered a sub here just to use the bathroom. I work on a cruise ship that docks in DC and don't get much time off the boat. I chose to spend a little of it here and it was a terrible decision. I tried both bathroom doors, and one of the employees walked in front of me and unlocked it with a key right after I tried it and found it locked. I thought he was being nice since he'd just seen me try to open it. Instead he walked into the bathroom and closed it on my face. I went into the other room when it opened a few minutes later,and after about two minutes the staff began banging on the door. When I told them I was in there they banged a couple more times and then left. They came back 3 minutes later and pounded on the door for a full minute or two, all the while I'm yelling that I'm using it. Horrible way to treat paying customers."
"179|1|I eat here practically every day, ordering ahead on the Subway app and having my order made correctly every time with no wait. Every employee handles their job well, and the options are just like any Subway. I do wish they had more sugar-feee drink options (plain unsweetened tea would be nice), but that's my only disappointment. Oh, did I mention that it's a bit cheaper than the variety of food trucks serving burritos for $12?"
"180|2|Yikes!! Came here for a quick lunch before meeting with a client and the cashier, Kalman (his name was SCRIBBLED on his name tag but I could make out the KAL and the MAN) was yelling at me for asking why my spinach wrapped veggie delight cost $8? Honestly I was pretty shocked at how aggressive he was- I stepped back cause he was pretty awful, even the people at the store were looking at him like he was a little off the rocker. To the owners of this location, please hire the right people, train your staff and get rid of the ones that do not know how to politely speak to customers- customer service is super important! Also when I asked for the managers name he said 'ma'am don't ask me who the manager is!'"" Honestly- I realized pretty quickly he was not at all fit to speak to and should not be working in this type of environment... matter of fact not sure where he can work with that horrible attitude.  Just a suggestion to all future customers there is a Subway just 3 blocks away across the Navy Yard metro which is wayyy better! I'm sure the corporate office will better handle this unfortunate situation."
"181|3|This Subway is pretty good. The sandwiches pretty much taste like they do everywhere else. The one thing I will say about this particular Subway is that it is always very clean. I have seen some Subways that were pretty messy and therefore made me scared to eat there. I will also say that I am probably a little biased because this Subway is literally right around the corner for me, so anything that is close to my apartment is always a plus in my eyes :) It's also great that it's right across the street from Safeway, so you can go there and get a bag of chips for only 35 cents instead of $1-something (I know, I'm cheap). haha"
"182|3|The food tastes just like any other Subway and that is always a good sign. The restaurant area was clean. However, when we walked in it looked like they were closing up, but it was only six o'clock. The two men that were working were very nice and although they wore gloves while making our sandwiches, my mom saw one of them scratch his leg with his gloves on and it grossed her out. The bathrooms were not very clean and could have used a good wipe down and the trash needed to be taken out. $5 footlongs are the way to go."
"183|2|Really?  Aren't there a lot of unemployed people in DC who actually WANT a job?  I waited while one of the guys (don't know his name, but it was around 6 pm on a Tuesday night) literally sat on a stool and talked on his cell phone. The other employee, Stephen, was AWESOME.  He was literally running around and refilling the bins for the veggies and cheese.  He took 2 orders, until FINALLY, the other guy got off of the stool, strolled over, and started helping.  Stephen was extremely courteous and really hard working.  The other guy should be fired and Stephen should be promoted.  It's fascinating to me that Subway allows its employees to act this way."
"184|1|Great service. Wonderful, accommodating staff. Clean restaurant and bathrooms. Their tuna is the best of any Subway- just enough mayo to hold it together. I've enjoyed my meal every time I go here."
"185|2|A message to the manager of this location. The image provided in this review is simply unacceptable. All customers should be required to wear masks during the pandemic. My wife went in to pick up dinner this afternoon from here and sent me this photo. Not cool...  and not safe either. Please place a sign on the door asking/requiring all customers wear masks during this time...   c'mon, this is common sense."
"186|2|This subway location is overall okay but this one particular day I had a really bad experience. I came to this subway June 8th, 2020 and I heard there was a buy one get one free offer but only through the app. I was already at the subway location so I ordered through my phone and rather than waiting in the car I just decided to wait in store. When I arrive I see one employee helping out their only customer at the time, while I can tell the other is already starting my order. I wasn't planning on ordering in-store so I just decided to stand to the side until it was ready. The man asked if we needed anything and I replied ""I'm just waiting for the online order"" then stood off to the side. Between when I walked in until my order was finished, they only had 2 customers. So tell me why once I was given my order, I was lectured about how not to rush them when they had other orders and how I was ""stressing him out"" trying to finish my order.1. I never asked him to rush to finish my order I was willing to wait a while knowing I had just ordered 2. He has already started my order as I walked into the store, it was already in the process so what was the issue?3. You had 2 customers if you're stressed over rushing to take care of 2 customers the food business isn't for you Will never be coming back here thanks to this experience I shouldn't have to be lectured about what you're not able to handle."
"187|2|This review is for the plaza location of the Subway restaurant chain in Springfield, VA and is written in September 2019 upon a re-visit.  Have been to this location several times while passing by over the course of 4-years from weekdays to weekends.GOOD NEWS!  The management has overcome the vagrant problem(s) of individuals sitting in the dining room, passed out, or locking themselves in the bathroom for prolonged sessions denying paying customer use.  Yay! That took about 2-years...MEH, NEWS!  The food quality here is on the lower-side of the Subway chain.  Items shown on special banners and ads, are not usually available, and staff just ""forget"" to take them down.  The chips are often understocked with small selections, drink station runs low on the items in the 'tanks' and getting napkins here, seems too hard to achieve.The staff: Meh.  Appear to be teenagers mostly, who are slow to meet/greet, and even slower to make the food.  Oblivious to longer lines, speeding up production, or getting the correct prices to ring-up for checkout.  While this location has high visibility and a steady stream of walk-in business, don't appear to be able to reach the next level of quality and service."
"188|1|I came here for dinner tonight with the hopes of getting the daily deal promotion.  Today they were offering the tuna sandwich meal that included chips and a drink for $6.49.  I was really craving tuna today for some reason, but at the last minute I changed my mind and opted for the pizza.  The pizza that they offered here is quite small, some would consider a personal size and it sells for about $4.00. I decided to go for it because of the fact that it only had 730 calories which isn't bad for a pizza.  They have some really cool vegetarian options here as well.  The pizza was cooked and ready in about 2 minutes and it was very hot.  They two workers were very friendly and informative.  This restaurant is clean too and conveniently located, I like it."
"189|2|One person working, line 6 long, daily sub is meatball, yet they are out of meatball at 4:45 pm.  Unacceptable"
190|1|Love this place. Excellent smell and always good service. If there is a little line it always moves at a good pace. They send coupons sometimes too. Fresh cookies are very tasty too- my favorite is double chocolate chip. The meatball subs are always good here too.
"191|3|I don't frequent this location much but when I do, the service and sandwiches has always been okay, nothing special. It's close to me but the congested parking and small store size are a turnoff. The staff are usually friendly and make quick subs. There's also a subway down the street in Springfield (next to Michaels) that's much nicer to dine in at and less crowded."
"192|1|Clean, friendly, fresh, tasty and fast!  You won't catch me reviewing sub places very often, but considering there are about six Subways in the Springfield area, I vote this one the best! The title of this review does not begin to express why this one stands out, only adding convenience and parking will make it better. The guy who runs the place, and his staff are always pleasant and helpful. This is the Subway to visit within a five mile radius!"
"193|2|The staff running the register at this particular Subway will tell you chips and drink is extra, even when the sign advertising the $6 meal specifically states that it includes chips and drink.  She ignored the sign even when I pointed it out. After speaking to eachother in another language only then did she state $6 plus tax $6.36.   she was hoping to make additional profit. I am sure that scam had to work before as she didn't even turn to look at the sign when I corrected her. Warn your kids and neighbors."
