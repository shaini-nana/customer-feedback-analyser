i was just insulted for no reason all i wanted is a tuna sandwich i love subway but it's always bad treatment when i go there except for the old guy with the mustache
"it is a national chain that specializes in making depressing, overpriced and substandard sandwiches."
"the sandwich maker put in 2 slices, count them, 1 & 2 slices of roast beef---on a footlong!"
"the thing freakin cost me $8, just for the sandwich alone!!"
i don't think a cold cut sandwich food tax is $3 dude!what a rip off..pssshh!
"i managed to finish the sandwich, but that's the best thing i could say right now."
the sandwiches here just don't make the cut for me anymore.
i just ordered a meatball sandwich given that i like meatball sandwiches and it's the sandwich of the day.
"today, i ordered another meatball sub, and this time, i added a tuna sandwich to my order."
the sandwiches are amazing.
"not only was i overchared, the quality of both sandwiches was sub par."
"i come here almost every week, and the stale bread has become very noticeable, and started spoiling the whole sandwich."
"i asked to substitute the steak on a steak, egg, and cheese on flatbread for turkey, the sandwich maker refused, i asked why, he said that he couldn't, which i know not to be the case since i typically purchase breakfast from the columbia pike location only a mile up the road from this pentagon city location."
"i regret that decision now because i asked the sandwich maker why he couldn't substitute the meat, and he says that it costs more, which i would expect, i assume different stores operate differently."
"i said okay, and the sandwich maker looked puzzle as i stood there."
"i would hate to make another change to inconvenience or complicate this man's day.i pay for my item and stand at register for a second, the puzzled look comes on the sandwich maker's face again."
"he prints it out, i take it, and leave.now sitting in my office enjoying a very good sandwich, i notice my receipt."
i will attach a photo to show you all i am not making this up: he changes me for a tuna sandwich with extra tuna!?!
"stay on the menu, improvised sandwiches will cost you."
"they assumed what i wanted on my sandwich, which they didn't get right at all and when i asked them to change the cheese from american to cheddar they just ignored me and kept making it."
"they assumed i wanted toasted sandwich toasted, which i did not want."
and they did not use gloves to make the sandwich.
then to top it off i bit into a long greasy hair then found i opened the sandwich to find another hair.
"the sandwich makers greeted me far better than expected, for what they had to endure from the customers in front of me."
best sandwich place.you step up to the counter.
you tell the person what type of sandwich you want.
i didn't even get the right sandwich when they handed it me and they were rude
"service was great and friendly, i got my sandwich toasted with the toppings i wanted, and it tasted fresher than any other subways i've been to.their credit card machine was down, so cash only."
skip to the next subway if you really want to eat a sandwich or a salad.
everything i asked for felt like an inconvenience and i had to ask for extra everything because she'd only put a tiny bit of everything on the sandwich.
"solid, and one of the least disastrous subway shops i've been to, as i find that so many of these sandwich ""artists"" can abuse and misuse the ingredients that more often than not give the whole franchise a bad name, and take this from someone who worked at multiple locations over a number of years.service is quick, although we have never been here during lunch rush, and shop is always clean and bright."
my co-worker found a grasshopper in his sandwich today.
i've never found one in my sandwiches here.b.
service is super fast (perhaps too fast to notice a grasshopper going into a sandwich??)c.
"he refunded my colleague's money, plus gave him a new sandwich and some cookies."
"as i waited in line, i thought long and hard about what it really takes to be a sandwich artist.long and hard.for 2 minutes.while i credit myself with the ability to have made that sandwich with a bit more finesse than the young lady that helped me, i thought:""not everyone can be that talented."
"anyway, this subway is clean and the staff is fast, friendly and gives you lots of food on your sandwich."
so you want a quick and cheap sandwich?
he always asks if you want your sandwich cut and today wrapped half in foil when we said we weren't sure if we could finish it.
"these locations (two permanent and a cart) were pioneers with the subway breakfast sandwiches, which are not great but actually have healthier options that any of the other fast food places in the building."
"the ladies there for some reason always have enough bread, enough meats, cheese, and veggies to have a sandwich for me regardless of the time of the work day.the only bad thing is that there is no toaster machine here so i have to eat my sandwiches cold."
the steak sandwich is my favorite for lunch once a week.
i went to buy three sandwiches on this subway and ordered two 6-inch tuna and one 12-inch meatballs.
"however, i let it pass and asked for cheddar cheese and when i saw that they added very little to my sandwich, i thought that oor favir they would add a little more cheese and silvia replied that that could not be, that she gave me the exact measurement,  as far as i know legally, a measurement is not done by hand but by a meter."
"in view of that, i decided not to take my sandwich and stay with the desire to eat."
i recommend no one to go to this subi went to buy three sandwiches on this subway and ordered two 6-inch tuna and one 12-inch meatballs.
"however, i let it pass and asked for cheddar cheese and when i saw that they added very little to my sandwich, i thought that oor favir they would add a little more cheese and silvia replied that that could not be, that she gave me the exact measurement,  as far as i know legally, a measurement is not done by hand but by a meter."
"in view of that, i decided not to take my sandwich and stay with the desire to eat."
i recommend no one to go to this subway.also i sent an email to the owner of the subway restaurant and i spoke with him by phone and he told me that he was going to decide for me to go to the restaurant to get my sandwich again and it's almost 6:00 pm and i still haven't had lunch  .
their sandwiches?
while i ate my sandwich i felt a little hurried because the guy mopping the floor was waiting to mop where i was.
despite the derive i gave it three stars because my sandwich was still good.
"i decided on the ruben, and had a sandwich with the bread not toasted, meat was cold after biting into it and cheese only partially melted."
if you want a real sandwich go to the end of the corner to the diner and they will serve you a proper sandwich.
"i am not the kind of person to take my sandwich back and ask for a redue ,but this is one occasion i should have."
"the employees, scowling throughout the manufacture of my sandwich and those before and after me, were literally throwing the food onto the sandwiches and back into the bins, with stray vegetables flying everywhere."
the sandwich artists are really nice and are efficient when getting your order done.
she had her nose turned up while making my sandwich.
threw the toppings on the sandwich.
"two other black ladies came in and were at the counter to buy cookies, i looked at clarysa and she had her nose turned up while staring at them in which she had no interaction with them.young white guy was getting a sandwich made and i didn't see that same expression on her face."
"!you would assume that if they are wearing gloves and preparing your sandwich that it would be clean... well, not here."
i came home and opened up my tuna foot long sandwich.... there was an inch of curly black hair on the first half of my sandwich!!!
"exactly, this place is dirty- this hair; it must have been in the olives or vegetables because the curly hair was found at the very top of the sandwich."
"this time, it was on the outside of the sandwich on the wrapper!"
i am assuming the employee who was helping me had long arm hairs and was shedding onto the sandwich ?
"i sure am at a loss for when i first walked into a subway franchise.type of cuisine: fast, healthy food by way of easy-to-prepare sandwiches, made to order - right in front of the customer - using freshly baked breads, select sauces and a variety of fresh, delicious toppings.ambiance: this subway location, similar to other subway's, but found in the ballston common mall food court, has a kiosk set-up with yellow tones, plastic and laminate, food court seating and an order counter with the toppings for each sandwich in plain view behind the plexi-glass window panel.what i ordered: my husband ordered a foot-long oven crisp chicken sandwich ($5.50) on whole wheat bread."
"in the mood for a salad, i turned the turkey avocado sandwich ($5.50) into a salad (additional $0.75 for one scoop of avocado): with shredded lettuce, tomato, green bell peppers, red onion, olives, sliced pepperoncinis, two strips of bacon, a small ice cream scoop of squished avocado and chicken instead of turkey, topped with a honey-mustard dressing.what i loved: easily accessible, convenient location and a quick, relatively inexpensive take-out dinner.why i loved it: i loved sharing our first meal, together, as husband and wife in our new apartment!cost: low to average ($5-$8 per sandwich/salad)"
"sweet sandwich maker lady, thank you for starting my day off on the right foot :)"
"i frequent this location (just got us some sandwiches last night) mainly because it's conveniently close to where i reside... but i have to say that the food has never been terrible, always pretty fresh, the inside is always clean & the service is usually pretty decent!"
i watch the man (whom i hate when he makes my sandwiches) take four tiny scoops that equal up to one scoop and spread it across my sandwich.
the only reason i give this subway 4 stars and not 5 was because i felt guilty and uncomfortable when i was approached by a guy to buy him a sandwich.
she did not ask my friend for her order and started putting up the food while my sandwich was in the oven.
my friend didn't even want a sandwich just cookies.
the woman who works there barely talks and scowls as she makes the sandwiches.
sandwich making process was fine but once i get to the counter i encounter someone that's talking on the phone.
got three different sandwiches each time and all were good.
many of the workers have been with the company for a few years and are highly skilled sandwich artists.
they put ingredients on my sandwich i purposely removed from my online order because i'm allergic.
"the add on lady disappeared, so the guy in front if me had his toasted sandwich getting all cold and sitting there for seven minutes."
"so, finally he makes my sandwiches, everything is fine, i get to the register, and this rude woman begins her nonsense."
"i just wanted my sandwich... well now she starts talking to bread dough  and interrupting his busy playing with raw dough time, and she says, ""this woman wants the cheap juice with her coupon."
i can pay the $5 for an extra sandwich.
you can do all of our sandwiches in 2 minutes since all you have to do is slice them and meat them and send them off... come on.
"subway is subway - i enjoyed my sandwich, which was just what i ordered."
"the only problem we had is that we ordered cookies, and paid for them, but when we arrived at our destination to eat our sandwiches - we discovered that we left without the cookies."
"the sandwiches are skinny and lacking in produce, and the wait time is unreasonably long in the mornings, with lots of customers lining up for breakfast and only one person making sandwiches."
"no more sad, dry sandwiches."
i ordered online and the sandwiches were ready at the appropriate time.
"in fact, after you successfully order your sub, the attendants stand in front of the vegetables and condiments that you add onto your sandwich and say one word...""and""."
"there were only two people sitting down and eating, and it took no time for me to place my sandwich order."
"surprisingly, this restaurant chain has kept their prices pretty reasonable, compared with some of the other sandwich shops in town."
"ate a foot long, but lost five pounds......i guess subway sandwiches are diet food"
"there was a long line for me to order my breakfast sandwich, so when it came time to pay, the manager gave me a free cookie."
the food here was pretty horrible and i couldn't even finish my other half of my sandwich (and i'm like the queen of pigs).
did not ask if i wanted my sandwich toasted & seemed to struggle with keeping up with the few things i wanted on the sandwich.
"bad:like all subways, they put very little cold cuts on the sandwich."
"i ordered from them thru door dash, as received my sandwiches i can smell  something strong like bad bo,  emanating from my order."
i first i thought i know i added extra red onions but onions do not smell like as i open all the sandwiches they all contain onions that were not edible and smelled disgusting.
"i can't believe that the subway sandwich did not smell that order nor did the door dash delivery employee, the funny thing he actually thought it really bad bo."
"first i ordered a turkey, bacon, avacado, only to find out after they made the sandwich that their out of avacado."
"then i ordered a chicken, ranch, bacon melt only to find out they're out of ranch, again after they made the sandwich."
"that's where i lose my appetite.btw, i love they're sandwiches that's why i was surprised i was treated and experienced like that."
rahman is the worst sandwich maker ever.
my simple (one topping) sandwiches are usually made incorrectly.
would you like your sandwich on an old bread?
"clean, pleasant experience and tiaquanna took great care in making my sandwich."
i went there and order to sandwich not gonna go to detail.
i routinely have to ask for additional vegetables as their standard is literally one thread of onion and one small piece of pepper per sandwich.
today they were out of both tuna and seafood so i left without a sandwich.
the sandwich was great.
i looked at the menu and noticed that the sandwich that i had bought last week was $7.99?
she had a sandwich and a soda mind you my meal was $8.
"i kid you not, the lady had a 6 foot sandwich and a soda."
this used to be my go to place for a quick sub sandwich.
the sandwiches pretty much taste like they do everywhere else.
"the two men that were working were very nice and although they wore gloves while making our sandwiches, my mom saw one of them scratch his leg with his gloves on and it grossed her out."
today they were offering the tuna sandwich meal that included chips and a drink for $6.49.
"i don't frequent this location much but when i do, the service and sandwiches has always been okay, nothing special."
