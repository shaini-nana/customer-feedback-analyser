"yesterday i visit the rajagiriya outlet and order one oyako burger don , one seafood curry rice , one terriyaki chicken roll and a salmon firework roll must say they 've lose it as a whole , very disappointing , the sushi role be kind of ok , but the oyako don be terrible as well , lack flavour and it be kinda rice with some water boil chicken !"
compliment burger to the chef !
