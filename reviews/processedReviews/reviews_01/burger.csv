"yesterday i visited the rajagiriya outlet and ordered one oyako burger don, one seafood curry rice, one terriyaki chicken roll and a salmon firework roll
must say they've lost it as a whole, very disappointing,  the sushi roles were kind of ok, but the oyako don was terrible as well, lacking flavour and it was kinda rice with some water boiled chicken!"
compliments burger to the chef!
