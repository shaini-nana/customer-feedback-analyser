superb excellent service and food be pizza very tasty
"Yesterday I visit the Rajagiriya outlet and order one Oyako burger don , one seafood curry rice , one Terriyaki chicken roll and a salmon firework roll must say they 've lose it as a whole , very disappointing , the sushi role be kind of ok , but the Oyako don be terrible as well , lack flavour and it be kinda rice with some water boil chicken ! have to pour soy sause to get some taste over it ! the seafood curry rice be the other let down ! there be no more than three prawn piece , i think one prawn be cut and use , and some tiny stingy piece of calamari , no fish or crab though it say seafood , also no seaweed as well ! the good part be , potato be fill over ! So guess why a person order a potato curry comming Shushi Bar very disappointed and will never be visit also will never be recommend anyone too , as a Japanes lover this be a massive let down"
