"until recently, the service was dreadful and the length of time it took to get a simple pepperoni pizza and breadsticks could be as early as 45 minutes if the place was empty and as far as refills, forget about it."
"i don't know how pizza hut could get a medium cheese and pepperoni pizza wrong not once, not twice but 3 times!!!"
i went in to the store and ordered a cheese and pepperoni pizza the cashier said it would be ready in about 15 minutes.
"another 15 minutes later the cook asked the cashier what i ordered he said ""oops i made the wrong thing, i made half cheese and olives, i will start the order now""  an hour later and the 3rd attempt at a simple pizza,  i finally get my cheese and pepperoni."
ordered a large supreme without pepperoni.
"hi there yelpers, i haven't been to this pizza hut in years and finally today 3/6/20 we decided to get a large pie with pineapple, a large pie with pepperoni and an order of 12 honey bqe bone in chicken wings."
"the food was given to us pretty quickly which i'm always concerned about but since the pizza boxes were hot we just kept on going home, once we got home the cheese on the pizza was dry, the pineapples were minimal, looked and tasted old like it was reheated and waiting there before we even ordered and the same goes for the pepperoni pizza."
"i specifically ordered without pepperoni,  but there it is.so, okay, they're eager to put extra stuff i don't want on my take out?"
me & my friends came here one at this pizza hut i had the pepperoni pizza it was ok...
they got a 5$ deal going on and what not so i ordered me a hand tossed pepperoni and pineapple pizza with bbq and medium buffalo wings .
after arriving to pick my dinner box up of 2 medium pepperoni pies.
"you can make your own pizza with whatever toppings you want, like pepperoni or mushrooms."
i seriously think one time i had spoiled pepperoni on my pizza because it was sour smelling & tasting.
