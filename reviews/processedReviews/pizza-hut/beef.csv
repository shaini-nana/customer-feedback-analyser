"we go in about between 9-10pm on a sunday and ordered a large stuff crust pizza with extra extra beef, pineapple, and no sauce on the pizza and sauce on the side for me."
"hand-tossed, 1/2 with beef, ham, & pepperoni; other 1/2 with beef, onion, mushroom, & spinach."
"the beef is kinda like the sausage: ""meh."
"""will say that the pork topping is right in the middle of the beef and sausage (all 3 of which are ""meh"").veggie lovers: the mushrooms are _fresh_ (not canned like many other places), and the onions and spinach are fresh."
