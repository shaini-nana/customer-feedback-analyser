"we go in about between 9-10pm on a sunday and ordered a large stuff crust pizza with extra extra beef, pineapple, and no sauce on the pizza and sauce on the side for me."
"hand-tossed, 1/2 with beef, ham, & pepperoni; other 1/2 with beef, onion, mushroom, & spinach."
"the beef is kinda like the sausage: ""meh."
"""will say that the pork topping is right in the middle of the beef and sausage (all 3 of which are ""meh"").veggie lovers: the mushrooms are _fresh_ (not canned like many other places), and the onions and spinach are fresh."
"finally, i had a serving of a surprisingly good pasta casserole with spiral pasta, ground beef, tomato sauce, and cheese.bluntly, while nothing was disgusting and what was available was pretty good, it felt to me like this pizza hut really is just ""mailing it in"" on their buffet."
