"two years apart and neither time was i able to eat my meal   don't get me wrong, i love love love pizza hut.the last time i went to this particular pizza hut, i just ordered a diet coke  and an order of bread sticks."
the breadsticks were very hard that i could not even bite it.
the first breadsticks literally made a snapping sound when i. broke it.i tried to eat the breadsticks.
i dunked the bread stick into the sauce that they gave me.
well  i couldn't    the breadsticks were really hard as rocks.i took my order up to the cashier.
i sat down with my warm breadsticks.
it was the same breadsticks.
"i made a joke and took out a unbroken breadstick and was more or less playing the drums off the table so, i threw the breadsticks away and left.also this location is not really that clean."
cheese was super extra thin while the bread was super thick.
"i ordered a large pizza with three toppings, breadsticks, and a 2 liter of soda and it was the 15 dollars deal of the day."
oh and ph breadsticks with the sauce is just as amazing.
"absolutely pathetic :( the breadsticks were stale and i have to pay for my extra marinara (i eat the crust like breadsticks and dip, try it, you'll thank me).that said, delivery was superquick (weekday 3pm-ish order, was here, 5 min from location in less than 30 minutes)."
i ordered bread sticks and a personal pan pizza.
"to my dismay, the bread sticks were over cooked but enjoyable enough."
i live exactly a block and a half away so theres no reason my breadsticks should come so hard they're basically long croutons at this point.
breadsticks were trash never again.
"the bread sticks that came with the order , reminded me of home plate , with sand on it except square."
"this past saturday, i was in the bronx for a kiddie party..... as i arrived rather late and noticed all the pizza had been eaten and many of us leftover were still hungry.....it was suggested we get some pizza hut, too bad i was not lucky enough for it to actually arrive.i placed an order online for four pizzas and breadsticks at 8pm..around 8:50 i started to wonder what was taking so long, by 9:10 everyone wanted to know what was taking so long."
"they have 6-7 pizzas on deckdeck at all times, 2 bread stick varieties (cinammon and desert (garlic))."
they also serve pasta and separate marianara for the bread sticks.
when i placed my order with this location i was expecting to receive 8 breaded wings.
you have to be really stupid to not know how to cook a pizza through before you serve it to a customer.2) you still owe me a supreme pizza and i'm going to get it delivered to my home for free with extra bread sticks for my trouble.this happened at 6:45 on june 5th of 2017.
omg was so excited that pizza hut finally opened in my area ..... the pizza was not up to standard it tasted like a knockoff frozen pizza the bread was very thick and  very dry the wings horrible i will stay with papa johns or dominoes
"bread sticks and wings, i was informed that the wait will be 30mins-45mins to receive my food."
they delivered a burn up pizza and breadsticks with no sauce.
i ordered a medium sausage and breadsticks and it was on.
"i kind of laughed as i was reading the other reviews of this pizza hut, but yes, this place really is comical in an ""oh god, i can't believe i'm about to eat this"" kind of way.rus walked in and ordered 8 wings and cheesy bread (didn't even get a pizza)."
"it wasn't even cut correctly.and the ""breadsticks"" were a square of pre-formed bread product with a film of butter or oil around the outside and poorly-indented perforations with which one is apparently supposed to separate the ""sticks."
i ordered bread sticks.
i was given plain bread sticks that was barely cut.
food came fast but the bread sticks were not cut all the way ... you can tell it was just a half assed order things thrown in the bag and it was not ass good as other places first and last time ordering from here .... 5.2/10
"ordered large supreme pan, pasta, breadsticks and fries."
"so where is my breadsticks,  ""let me check""."
"""we don't have any breadsticks at the moment."""
"""what, you don't have a huge pile of breadsticks in the back?"""
"i ordered garlic chicken wings, and the wife ordered a small pizza and some bread sticks."
about 10 minutes later the wifes pizza came out.. 10..20..about 25 minutes later the waitress forgot about the breadsticks.
"waited 2 hours for a simple delivery, one personal pan pizza, breadsticks, and a stuffed crust pizza, once the driver gets here, he's missing a personal pan we ask to see the receipt, the personal pan pizza was deleted off the ticket, no phone call, nothing, completely unacceptable."
"i recommend that you just stay away to be safe but if you really need the pizza hut flavor, order bread sticks and a personal size pizza."
you can not go wrong with their supreme pizza and breadsticks with extra seasoning.
i decided to try their new hut favorite flavor sticks-- classic breadsticks with a garlic buttery twist.
"one downside, they now charge for extra seasoning on the breadsticks."
thank god my kids eat the topping before they eat the breading other wise they would have been so sick.
"i had the personal pie she had breadsticks, and we both ordered a soda."
the bread sticks was cold.
it only tasted like cheese and bread.
"sauce was missing from the breadsticks last time i ordered, chicken was short on sauce or had too much sauce, pizza toppings missing, etc."
since it was for someone we asked for it to be sent out.tonight was the second time where bread sticks were wrong.
"i didn't have time to argue, so i paid $3 for a ranch cup, a blue cheese cup and a cup of marinara for my breadsticks and wings."
"my breadsticks were not cut up, so i just had a huge chunk of bread with no score lines to even rip it."
"the breadsticks had a cup of marinara sauce, which i was not informed of when i was purchasing sauce and dips."
"got a good coupon from t-mobile tuesday, ordered online, it was a nice deal for a large pizza, breadsticks with cinnamon sticks."
i would give 5+ stars alone for the breadsticks honestly.
i dont like how this pizza hut charges for a delivery fee.medium supreme pizza+breadsticks+coke+garlicsauce= 30.00+tax&tipare you kidding me?
"if the pizza and the breadsticks actually tasted good, i wouldnt mind.never again.bye forever."
"the manager on wednesday and saturday is super cheap, i ordered breadstick a few times, and he never even give the marinara sauce.i asked him, where is the sauce that suppose come with the stick."
"and he goes like saying the sauce doesn't come with it.then i ask him why does the menu says the breadstick comes with the marinara sauce, then he hesitantly gave the the sauce.i'm mean whats with this guy trying to save a few cent by cheating us out of the sauce.would someone from pizza hut corporate please fire this assh@@e.very pissed long time cust"
supposedly now breads ticks do not come with sauce
burnt breadsticks and pizza.
do a survey & get a free breadstick.
"i ordered a large pizza, a pasta, breadsticks and a root beer."
"what i got, over an hour and a half later, was the wrong pizza, bone cold pasta, breadsticks without sauce, and a pepsi , which is just motor oil with sugar, ( the driver said they were out of my soda, but they could have atleast called and asked what i wanted instead of root beer), dropped off by an incredibly rude driver."
upon delivery it is missing half my breadsticks!!!
they delivered my missing breadsticks.
free breadsticks...
"instead of cheese sticks, they've given me breadsticks each time."
"bull-ya for the veggie toppings, imo!yeah, my 1/2 was so ""pretty"" and tasty!other orders we've done include the ""boxes"" (dinner box and big family dinner box): the kids love the bread sticks and the cinnamon bread sticks."
"appreciate they put the frosting on the side for the cinnamon bread sticks: 1 of my kids prefers them without, while the other loves them with it.recap: if we got a free large ""anything"" pizza from rewards points, then you know we order here a lot."
one experience in particular: they were busy and the pizza girl making the cheese bread and pizzas was pitching a fit from stress.
"when she threw down a box of cheese bread with a pizza and specified it as being for me, rather than the other guests who'd been waiting longer than i had, i thought i'd gotten through to her- that she'd identified me as a friend."
opening up the box of my trophy cheese bread i realized something was wrong- there was no cheese!
"it was just a flat piece of pizza bread, cut into it's regular pieces."
this was no mistake from stress- she had still cut the bread in case  i might like to dip it in my marinara sauce.
"went in to order a pizza, crazy bread and cheese sticks since they are supposed to be pre-made and ready."
"even though she tendered my order correctly they made my pizza, then made the cheese bread twenty minutes later."
they skimped so much on this meat lover's pizza that it was more like focaccia bread.
"in fact, i've had better focaccia bread and would have preferred it.i don't know as i would ever try the buffet, but i might -- since i love a bargain."
"i tried ""wingstreet"" here a couple nights ago, taking out 10 ""burnin' hot"" wings and cheesy breads for about $11."
"i chose ""traditional"" wings, though breaded ""bone-in"" and boneless ""bone-out"" are also available."
"cheesy breads were delicious and provided adequate heat relief.while waiting for my order, i noticed that pizza hut is still using those unique oval-shaped plates at their buffet."
