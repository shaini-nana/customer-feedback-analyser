"until recently, the service was dreadful and the length of time it took to get a simple pepperoni pizza and breadsticks could be as early as 45 minutes if the place was empty and as far as refills, forget about it."
we ordered cheesy bread sticks and the waitress brought us slices of bread with cheese.
!i ordered two large pizzas and cheese bread at 8:15pm on a tuesday.
"and when we picked up slices of each pizza, they felt like bread that hadn't been put into the oven for more than a minute or two."
it was like holding bread with melted cheese on top.
"on top of that, both of the pizzas were supposed to have flavored crusts, but they didn't.then i opened the box for the cheese bread and it actually was bread with melted cheese just placed on top."
"!i ordered 36 wings and cheesy bread, once i got the wings in my car it smelled like sweaty gym socksi called the store and spoke with the manager and received no sort of remorse, sympathy, nothing, she told me it's nothing she could do!"
this location to learn how to make pizzas and breadsticks like the target pizza hut pizza!!!
"came at a reasonable time after online ordering and amending the order on phone was easy as well.food came as expected and it was good, the old reliable pizza supreme and the breadsticks."
"the breadsticks had no sauce, i asked my waiter twice for some, but he either forgot both times or just didn't care."
"horrible service been waiting over a hour for a plain pie to dine in with, 1 hour 19 mins in and i got my cheesy bread and don't even get me started on how long i waited on drinks like 30 mins for a water and a pepsi.. really unorganized and staff seem to not even care."
i placed an order this past weekend and the only complaint was the cheesy bread.
"special deal :the big box dinner which is 2 medium one topping pizzas, one side order(wings, pasta or pizza rollers) and bread/cheese sticks for $22.85 after tax."
buffalo wings and breadsticks are great too.
we waited for 30 mins for some bread and wings...bread and wings!!
"two years apart and neither time was i able to eat my meal   don't get me wrong, i love love love pizza hut.the last time i went to this particular pizza hut, i just ordered a diet coke  and an order of bread sticks."
the breadsticks were very hard that i could not even bite it.
the first breadsticks literally made a snapping sound when i. broke it.i tried to eat the breadsticks.
i dunked the bread stick into the sauce that they gave me.
well  i couldn't    the breadsticks were really hard as rocks.i took my order up to the cashier.
i sat down with my warm breadsticks.
it was the same breadsticks.
"i made a joke and took out a unbroken breadstick and was more or less playing the drums off the table so, i threw the breadsticks away and left.also this location is not really that clean."
"buying the pizza, bread sticks, and soda separately is about $9."
"however, you do get a full pack of bread sticks much better suited for sharing than the gorging i do.my only real complaint is the continuous flow of non-customers using the bathroom."
cheese was super extra thin while the bread was super thick.
"i ordered a large pizza with three toppings, breadsticks, and a 2 liter of soda and it was the 15 dollars deal of the day."
oh and ph breadsticks with the sauce is just as amazing.
"absolutely pathetic :( the breadsticks were stale and i have to pay for my extra marinara (i eat the crust like breadsticks and dip, try it, you'll thank me).that said, delivery was superquick (weekday 3pm-ish order, was here, 5 min from location in less than 30 minutes)."
i ordered bread sticks and a personal pan pizza.
"to my dismay, the bread sticks were over cooked but enjoyable enough."
i live exactly a block and a half away so theres no reason my breadsticks should come so hard they're basically long croutons at this point.
breadsticks were trash never again.
"they have 6-7 pizzas on deckdeck at all times, 2 bread stick varieties (cinammon and desert (garlic))."
they also serve pasta and separate marianara for the bread sticks.
when i placed my order with this location i was expecting to receive 8 breaded wings.
you have to be really stupid to not know how to cook a pizza through before you serve it to a customer.2) you still owe me a supreme pizza and i'm going to get it delivered to my home for free with extra bread sticks for my trouble.this happened at 6:45 on june 5th of 2017.
omg was so excited that pizza hut finally opened in my area ..... the pizza was not up to standard it tasted like a knockoff frozen pizza the bread was very thick and  very dry the wings horrible i will stay with papa johns or dominoes
"bread sticks and wings, i was informed that the wait will be 30mins-45mins to receive my food."
they delivered a burn up pizza and breadsticks with no sauce.
i ordered a medium sausage and breadsticks and it was on.
"i kind of laughed as i was reading the other reviews of this pizza hut, but yes, this place really is comical in an ""oh god, i can't believe i'm about to eat this"" kind of way.rus walked in and ordered 8 wings and cheesy bread (didn't even get a pizza)."
"it wasn't even cut correctly.and the ""breadsticks"" were a square of pre-formed bread product with a film of butter or oil around the outside and poorly-indented perforations with which one is apparently supposed to separate the ""sticks."
i ordered bread sticks.
i was given plain bread sticks that was barely cut.
food came fast but the bread sticks were not cut all the way ... you can tell it was just a half assed order things thrown in the bag and it was not ass good as other places first and last time ordering from here .... 5.2/10
"ordered large supreme pan, pasta, breadsticks and fries."
"so where is my breadsticks,  ""let me check""."
"""we don't have any breadsticks at the moment."""
"""what, you don't have a huge pile of breadsticks in the back?"""
"i ordered garlic chicken wings, and the wife ordered a small pizza and some bread sticks."
about 10 minutes later the wifes pizza came out.. 10..20..about 25 minutes later the waitress forgot about the breadsticks.
"waited 2 hours for a simple delivery, one personal pan pizza, breadsticks, and a stuffed crust pizza, once the driver gets here, he's missing a personal pan we ask to see the receipt, the personal pan pizza was deleted off the ticket, no phone call, nothing, completely unacceptable."
"i recommend that you just stay away to be safe but if you really need the pizza hut flavor, order bread sticks and a personal size pizza."
you can not go wrong with their supreme pizza and breadsticks with extra seasoning.
i decided to try their new hut favorite flavor sticks-- classic breadsticks with a garlic buttery twist.
"one downside, they now charge for extra seasoning on the breadsticks."
i'm not beyond eating at a pizza hut!but i am beyond stale bread.
"i don't mean to knit-pick and i know all you have to do is pull it apart, but fresh pre-sliced bread comes apart effortlessly."
thank god my kids eat the topping before they eat the breading other wise they would have been so sick.
"i had the personal pie she had breadsticks, and we both ordered a soda."
