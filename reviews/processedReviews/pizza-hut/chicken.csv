"type chicken as i'm an avid kfc, kgc & you name it, most of my life, but this was another ridiculously bad experience at this location!!"
!my gf hesitated to eat any of it because she couldn't even tell if the white meat was really white meat (she doesn't like dark meat chicken) and i agreed.
we cut a piece in half and then dissected it because it still Â had sections that looked exactly like the dark meat chicken that i love..
all the food is coldand surprised to found the chicken wing we ordered is red rare or i should say.
"and when i was telling him about the chicken being red, he said i'll give you money back you keep the food!"
i just took all the pics of chicken.
the girl at the register was super polite and even gave my extra sauce for my chicken wings.
"i check on my pizza again and am told that there was no more chicken, no call or any type of notification whatsoever."
"they were really gracious and kind enough to redo our pizza (at their insistence) at no additional charge-the bbq chicken pizza is out of this world, we just did not notice on the menu it had bacon which neither one of us eats."
they gave us a chicken wings without sauces.
"i ordered garlic chicken wings, and the wife ordered a small pizza and some bread sticks."
"our drinks came out right away, then we were forgotten about.. 15 minutes later i recieved my cold chicken chunks with some garlic sauce poured over them."
entered the store 5 minutes early and my food was ready!thank you for really cold large pie pizza.thank you for 3 of the slices missing a lot of toppings.thank you for lack of cheese.thank you for burnt black chicken wings.thank you for not adding hot sauce as i ordered.i'm mostly thankful for the cashier not bagging my food and watched me bag it.please do not mess around and have conversations (3 employees including the manager) when there's a long line of customers especially in front of the register area.
this happens a lot where you order 10 or more and either they miscounted or just deliberately short you of two pieces of the chicken i don't trust this place.
"i ordered a medium pizza, topped with chicken, onions, and mushroom....i started off though with plain buffalo wings no sauce...they were boneless, more like popcorn chicken."
"we got the special that event, 1 large pie with 1 topping and 1 order of wings for 19$ (as per my so craving pizza hut for some odd reason) we got their deep dish with chicken and mild buffalo boneless wings."
"sauce was missing from the breadsticks last time i ordered, chicken was short on sauce or had too much sauce, pizza toppings missing, etc."
but the worst thing was the chicken wings!
pizza hut chicken wings have always been the best chicken wings ever.
have i seen chicken wings that still had many many!
it was definitely the most disgusting experience i have ever had with pizza hut and it also ruined my desire to eat chicken wings.
