"it's okay, because my red hot anger usually melts the cheese on top just fine.my friend and i jokingly refer to this kfc as 'the dungeon', because the main seating area is located underground(no windows)."
before i used to order dominoes but now i order pizza hut and it's worth it they're pizza is the best the cheese is delicious and i recommend renember god loves you
"the conversation went like this: "" can i have extra blue cheese with my wings"" and he responds "" nah""."
"the pizza terrible, barely any sauce, there barely is any cheese."
cheese was super extra thin while the bread was super thick.
or stay away!i already had many disappointed food from them but i kept ordered because my kids like cheese sticks.
after checking the food i requested my money back that's the last time i order from these bums lets go domino's there right next door came to the rescue in 38 min man i forgot how good that phillie cheese steak taste.
"ordered some mediums and it was all dough, no cheese, scanty toppings."
so i ordered a cheese pizza and not only did i wait an hour but when the pizza got here it was cold!
i was told thin and crispy pizza drys out easy like are u serious i've ordered pizza a thousand times and there's no reason the cheese on my pizza should be cold they are 5mins away from me and i waited an hour !!!!!
wasn't impressed with all the cheese and sauce either.
no cheese or sauce next time please.
"the cheese tasted cheap, but you get what you pay for."
"however, when i pulled apart the slices of my pizza, i found not one, but multiple strands of hair threaded in the middle of the pizza throughout the cheese in each slice of the pizza."
"it was as if someone had combed their hair with their hand and then stuck their hand in the cheese before they sprinkled it over my pizza.this is totally and inexplicably unacceptable, and downright disgusting."
the pizza cheese quality was ok.
"i have no problem paying extra for extra cheese, but if there was any extra cheese, it was negligible at best."
the crust and cheese was stiff as fuck.
"it was an unholy combination of microwaved pasta, barely cheesy cheese sticks and cardboard tasting pizza with barely any sauce or cheese."
"hand tossed, no cheese."
now i know having no cheese on there isn't the reason for my pizza to look like this.
so i canceled the rest of the order (cheese sticks and drinks) and just paid for the pizza.
displaying burnt cheese on pizza.
one young lady came back and noted that her pizza was cold and another man came back with the wrong order.when i arrived home and opened my pizza box i then realized my order was correct however my pizza was in fact cold and the cheese on the pizza was burnt.
loved pizza hut in the past always tastes good came to order some take out place was empty i ordered the special that came with 2 free toppings when i asked for extra cheese i was told that would be extra and was not considered a free topping wtf since when is extra cheese not considered a topping the girl explained it was company policy and not up to her.
the wings barely had sauce and the pizza had less cheese than the wings had sauce.
two cheese pizzas with burnt cheese was not my idea for a nice meal.
ordered delivery for cheese stuffed cheese pizza..told the lady over the phone to add some marinara sauces on the side..40 mins later it arrives with no sauces like i repeatedly told her to include and the pizza tasted like sh!t!!
"i had opted for the thin/crispy crust, which may have been my misstep; or maybe ordering olives/tomatoes/mushrooms instead of the safer cheese.or, maybe, it is no fault of my own, and this place just makes terrible pizza."
we got a cheesy crust pizza but they was no cheese in the crust.
"i finally found a pizza that both my wife and i  like.do you know what we don't like?thievery and fraud perpetrated by the workers.every time, that is, every time we use the app to order, we pay the price listed but there's always something missing.it's like you have to audit your own order every...single...time.especially when you order the stuffed crust or cheese sticks at ave d pizza hut.that's right, i'm calling you out, criminals!i shouldn't hve to check my order because the workers see the order from their app before they give it to me!wtf, pizza hut?"
they put stretchy cheese on top of the pizza.
they also put melted cheese inside the pizza crust.
"when i eat the cheese, it feels like i'm in cheesy heaven."
"cheese was dry, bacon was plasticky at this point."
"my husband and i placed an order for one ( 1 ) large cheese pizza online at 8:24 pm, at 8:57 pm we received a text saying "" pizza is out for delivery "" at 10:26 pm pizza was still not delivered."
"so, we waited at this point over two hours for 1 cheese pizza that never showed up and now up to a week for the refund."
"at first, i thought it was cheese melted narrowly but as i pulled it out, i was shocked to see super long hair of a lady."
i'm hungry and can't eat the pizza my friends ordered bc i'm allergic to cheese..finally he said he will bring the wings and they never came!!
the pizza that was sent to us was incorrect and the tomatoe sauce was expired cheese wouldnt even stick to it ( work in the restaurant industry at a high level so able to tell these thing) end results the kids got sick and almost ended up at the er for food poisoning.
entered the store 5 minutes early and my food was ready!thank you for really cold large pie pizza.thank you for 3 of the slices missing a lot of toppings.thank you for lack of cheese.thank you for burnt black chicken wings.thank you for not adding hot sauce as i ordered.i'm mostly thankful for the cashier not bagging my food and watched me bag it.please do not mess around and have conversations (3 employees including the manager) when there's a long line of customers especially in front of the register area.
i pulled it out thinking it was a strand of cheese and then proceeded to feel nauseous when i realized it was actually a hair and i had almost finished the p'zone.
just got my order..pizza is hard like cardboard and pasta smells like moldy cheese..this location needs to be shut down ...
nothing but mushy dough under the cheese.
ordered a large ultimate cheese pie & 16pc boneless garlic parmesan wings.
"my stomach turned as i realized the same hands she's itching away with are the hands that made my pizza, probably sprinkling her toe fungus in with the cheese."
broke down and ordered an original crust plain cheese and an original crust meat lovers.
cheese was lightly golden toasted.
"for the price i paid, i've could have gone to the cheese factory and paid the same price for a family of 5."
"the cheese had no stretch to it, there was barely any sauce and the quality of the ingredients were poor and the pizza was made poorly."
the cheese falls right off and it's very saucy.
"that's like ordering fries from mcdonald's, and they hand you seasoned fries with cheese on it."
"meat lovers, veggie, pepperoni, cheese, and 2 others i don't remember."
when we started eating the cheese pizza we saw that the cheese pizza had no marinara sauce.
it only tasted like cheese and bread.
the first time got only 1 order of cheese sticks when 2 were ordered and the pizza had the wrong toppings.
half of the pizza was practically just cheese with bits of pep and mushroom and the other half was just a pile of pepperoni and mushroom.
the cheese was hard and fell off the crust.
"i didn't have time to argue, so i paid $3 for a ranch cup, a blue cheese cup and a cup of marinara for my breadsticks and wings."
"sadly, the pizza was nothing special...not enough marinara sauce when i peeled back the cheese."
"i ordered a large pizza, wings, and two pastas but they gave me no napkins or chili flakes or grated cheese."
i had to specifically ask for some and all they threw in were 3 packets of cheese.. that was it.
"i received two of the same pizzas (the one that was missing was the only vegetarian option), one with an incorrect crust, and 4 cinnamon sticks and 2 cheese sticks (instead of 3 of each)."
"we've had takeout a few times from this location and the pizza has been very good- perfect, no black burns on the cheese, not soggy, toppings were good."
the pizzas were very mediocre lacking toppings and cheese mainly dough.
there was barely enough cheese on the pepperoni slice to cover the sauce.
we ordered a large cheese and a large pepperoni.
"they said ""oh sorry, we can make you another cheese but it's going to take 30 mins"" so he ended up coming home and paying for a pizza that won't be eaten."
"they messed up the first pizza, no cheese on one side  (how that happens is beyond me)."
"so we waited for a replacement which was even worse,  barely any sauce and less cheese than the first one."
"hardly any cheese, dough is not buttery and fluffy like it used to be, toppings are sparse."
"the last two times i've ordered from this location, i've ordered cheese sticks and pizza."
"instead of cheese sticks, they've given me breadsticks each time."
"however, the second time, when the guy opened the box to show me what i had ordered, as i was paying, i noticed the difference right away and actually asked him if those were indeed cheese sticks in the box because there was no cheese anywhere and the whole thing looked extremely dry."
"he lied and said 'they are cheese sticks, like you asked for'."
"so, i decided to try another pizza hut location a few days later and at that location, the cheese sticks were definitely cheese sticks."
these cheese sticks also looked identical to the ones in the pics on the pizza hut website.
the cheese was literally brown and the pizza was not warm at all.
"), and c) didn't think about but wondering now: celery or bleu cheese?"
one experience in particular: they were busy and the pizza girl making the cheese bread and pizzas was pitching a fit from stress.
"when she threw down a box of cheese bread with a pizza and specified it as being for me, rather than the other guests who'd been waiting longer than i had, i thought i'd gotten through to her- that she'd identified me as a friend."
opening up the box of my trophy cheese bread i realized something was wrong- there was no cheese!
"went in to order a pizza, crazy bread and cheese sticks since they are supposed to be pre-made and ready."
"even though she tendered my order correctly they made my pizza, then made the cheese bread twenty minutes later."
"ordered a large thin crust half pepperoni, half cheese pizza (delivered)."
"gave pizza hut a call to replace my blue cheese with ranch (same price, an easy change)."
very average pizza with too much cheese and oil.
"the workers were super friendly.- not as overwhelmingly greasy as i thought it was going to be.- pairs well with budweiser selectminus: - no one, no one, needs over a pound of meat and cheese."
