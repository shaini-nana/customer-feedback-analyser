we ordered cheesy bread sticks and the waitress brought us slices of bread with cheese.
i ordered extra cheese but this pizza had barely enough cheese top call it pizza.
!i ordered two large pizzas and cheese bread at 8:15pm on a tuesday.
it was like holding bread with melted cheese on top.
"on top of that, both of the pizzas were supposed to have flavored crusts, but they didn't.then i opened the box for the cheese bread and it actually was bread with melted cheese just placed on top."
barely any cheese on the slices and the bacon was more bacon fat pieces than anything.
i ordered cheese sticks and boneless chicken at 7:57 pm.
"i don't know how pizza hut could get a medium cheese and pepperoni pizza wrong not once, not twice but 3 times!!!"
i went in to the store and ordered a cheese and pepperoni pizza the cashier said it would be ready in about 15 minutes.
"he asked me what i ordered and that it was a cheese pizza and not mine, he asked the cook to make my pizza again since the order somehow disappeared."
"another 15 minutes later the cook asked the cashier what i ordered he said ""oops i made the wrong thing, i made half cheese and olives, i will start the order now""  an hour later and the 3rd attempt at a simple pizza,  i finally get my cheese and pepperoni."
my cheese pizzas are always burnt.
just purchased an $11+ pan medium cheese and it was equivalent to a 7-11 pizza that's been sitting under a hot lamp for a few hours.
i usually get the medium pan with chicken on the cheese pizza.
"the food was given to us pretty quickly which i'm always concerned about but since the pizza boxes were hot we just kept on going home, once we got home the cheese on the pizza was dry, the pineapples were minimal, looked and tasted old like it was reheated and waiting there before we even ordered and the same goes for the pepperoni pizza."
"food (medium supreme pizza, medium cheese pizza, and 8 wings) arrived within a reasonable time."
"special deal :the big box dinner which is 2 medium one topping pizzas, one side order(wings, pasta or pizza rollers) and bread/cheese sticks for $22.85 after tax."
"it's okay, because my red hot anger usually melts the cheese on top just fine.my friend and i jokingly refer to this kfc as 'the dungeon', because the main seating area is located underground(no windows)."
before i used to order dominoes but now i order pizza hut and it's worth it they're pizza is the best the cheese is delicious and i recommend renember god loves you
"the conversation went like this: "" can i have extra blue cheese with my wings"" and he responds "" nah""."
"the pizza terrible, barely any sauce, there barely is any cheese."
"now to the cheese and sause, both were lacking any substance."
cheese was super extra thin while the bread was super thick.
"ordered some mediums and it was all dough, no cheese, scanty toppings."
so i ordered a cheese pizza and not only did i wait an hour but when the pizza got here it was cold!
i was told thin and crispy pizza drys out easy like are u serious i've ordered pizza a thousand times and there's no reason the cheese on my pizza should be cold they are 5mins away from me and i waited an hour !!!!!
wasn't impressed with all the cheese and sauce either.
no cheese or sauce next time please.
"the cheese tasted cheap, but you get what you pay for."
"however, when i pulled apart the slices of my pizza, i found not one, but multiple strands of hair threaded in the middle of the pizza throughout the cheese in each slice of the pizza."
"it was as if someone had combed their hair with their hand and then stuck their hand in the cheese before they sprinkled it over my pizza.this is totally and inexplicably unacceptable, and downright disgusting."
the pizza cheese quality was ok.
"i have no problem paying extra for extra cheese, but if there was any extra cheese, it was negligible at best."
"it was an unholy combination of microwaved pasta, barely cheesy cheese sticks and cardboard tasting pizza with barely any sauce or cheese."
"hand tossed, no cheese."
now i know having no cheese on there isn't the reason for my pizza to look like this.
so i canceled the rest of the order (cheese sticks and drinks) and just paid for the pizza.
displaying burnt cheese on pizza.
one young lady came back and noted that her pizza was cold and another man came back with the wrong order.when i arrived home and opened my pizza box i then realized my order was correct however my pizza was in fact cold and the cheese on the pizza was burnt.
loved pizza hut in the past always tastes good came to order some take out place was empty i ordered the special that came with 2 free toppings when i asked for extra cheese i was told that would be extra and was not considered a free topping wtf since when is extra cheese not considered a topping the girl explained it was company policy and not up to her.
the wings barely had sauce and the pizza had less cheese than the wings had sauce.
two cheese pizzas with burnt cheese was not my idea for a nice meal.
ordered delivery for cheese stuffed cheese pizza..told the lady over the phone to add some marinara sauces on the side..40 mins later it arrives with no sauces like i repeatedly told her to include and the pizza tasted like sh!t!!
"i had opted for the thin/crispy crust, which may have been my misstep; or maybe ordering olives/tomatoes/mushrooms instead of the safer cheese.or, maybe, it is no fault of my own, and this place just makes terrible pizza."
we got a cheesy crust pizza but they was no cheese in the crust.
"i finally found a pizza that both my wife and i  like.do you know what we don't like?thievery and fraud perpetrated by the workers.every time, that is, every time we use the app to order, we pay the price listed but there's always something missing.it's like you have to audit your own order every...single...time.especially when you order the stuffed crust or cheese sticks at ave d pizza hut.that's right, i'm calling you out, criminals!i shouldn't hve to check my order because the workers see the order from their app before they give it to me!wtf, pizza hut?"
they put stretchy cheese on top of the pizza.
they also put melted cheese inside the pizza crust.
"when i eat the cheese, it feels like i'm in cheesy heaven."
"cheese was dry, bacon was plasticky at this point."
"my husband and i placed an order for one ( 1 ) large cheese pizza online at 8:24 pm, at 8:57 pm we received a text saying "" pizza is out for delivery "" at 10:26 pm pizza was still not delivered."
"so, we waited at this point over two hours for 1 cheese pizza that never showed up and now up to a week for the refund."
"at first, i thought it was cheese melted narrowly but as i pulled it out, i was shocked to see super long hair of a lady."
i'm hungry and can't eat the pizza my friends ordered bc i'm allergic to cheese..finally he said he will bring the wings and they never came!!
the pizza that was sent to us was incorrect and the tomatoe sauce was expired cheese wouldnt even stick to it ( work in the restaurant industry at a high level so able to tell these thing) end results the kids got sick and almost ended up at the er for food poisoning.
entered the store 5 minutes early and my food was ready!thank you for really cold large pie pizza.thank you for 3 of the slices missing a lot of toppings.thank you for lack of cheese.thank you for burnt black chicken wings.thank you for not adding hot sauce as i ordered.i'm mostly thankful for the cashier not bagging my food and watched me bag it.please do not mess around and have conversations (3 employees including the manager) when there's a long line of customers especially in front of the register area.
i pulled it out thinking it was a strand of cheese and then proceeded to feel nauseous when i realized it was actually a hair and i had almost finished the p'zone.
i had a bacon and cheese stuffed crust pizza.
just got my order..pizza is hard like cardboard and pasta smells like moldy cheese..this location needs to be shut down ...
nothing but mushy dough under the cheese.
ordered a large ultimate cheese pie & 16pc boneless garlic parmesan wings.
