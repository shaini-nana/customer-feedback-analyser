"two years apart and neither time was i able to eat my meal   don't get me wrong, i love love love pizza hut.the last time i went to this particular pizza hut, i just ordered a diet coke  and an order of bread sticks."
i ordered bread sticks and a personal pan pizza.
"to my dismay, the bread sticks were over cooked but enjoyable enough."
"the bread sticks that came with the order , reminded me of home plate , with sand on it except square."
they also serve pasta and separate marianara for the bread sticks.
you have to be really stupid to not know how to cook a pizza through before you serve it to a customer.2) you still owe me a supreme pizza and i'm going to get it delivered to my home for free with extra bread sticks for my trouble.this happened at 6:45 on june 5th of 2017.
"bread sticks and wings, i was informed that the wait will be 30mins-45mins to receive my food."
i ordered bread sticks.
i was given plain bread sticks that was barely cut.
food came fast but the bread sticks were not cut all the way ... you can tell it was just a half assed order things thrown in the bag and it was not ass good as other places first and last time ordering from here .... 5.2/10
"i ordered garlic chicken wings, and the wife ordered a small pizza and some bread sticks."
"i recommend that you just stay away to be safe but if you really need the pizza hut flavor, order bread sticks and a personal size pizza."
the bread sticks was cold.
since it was for someone we asked for it to be sent out.tonight was the second time where bread sticks were wrong.
"bull-ya for the veggie toppings, imo!yeah, my 1/2 was so ""pretty"" and tasty!other orders we've done include the ""boxes"" (dinner box and big family dinner box): the kids love the bread sticks and the cinnamon bread sticks."
"appreciate they put the frosting on the side for the cinnamon bread sticks: 1 of my kids prefers them without, while the other loves them with it.recap: if we got a free large ""anything"" pizza from rewards points, then you know we order here a lot."
