"the conversation went like this: "" can i have extra blue cheese with my wings"" and he responds "" nah""."
"uh i ordered wings dude"", he hangs up on me, but not before he makes some racist comments."
their wings are ok but over priced imo.
"ehhh i usually order for delivery, but for some reason it always takes them more than an hr to deliver a pizza and some wings and by the time it gets to me its already cold."
so it was sunday around 3pm and i usually get dominos because of the wings but i decided to get pizza hut because my fiancé loves it.
when i placed my order with this location i was expecting to receive 8 breaded wings.
upon receiving my order i received 8 boneless wings.
the wings were highly un satisfying in the sense that they were tough and slightly burnt.
we literally waited close to 1.5 hours for two medium pizzas and an order of eight bone in wings.
pizza and wings were fantastic.
the girl at the register was super polite and even gave my extra sauce for my chicken wings.
"i ordered a large pizza with 5 toppings, stuffed garlic knots, buffalo wings and a cookie pie thing and everything was fresh, hot and delicious."
they got a 5$ deal going on and what not so i ordered me a hand tossed pepperoni and pineapple pizza with bbq and medium buffalo wings .
and don't get me started on my uncooked boneless wings .
omg was so excited that pizza hut finally opened in my area ..... the pizza was not up to standard it tasted like a knockoff frozen pizza the bread was very thick and  very dry the wings horrible i will stay with papa johns or dominoes
"bread sticks and wings, i was informed that the wait will be 30mins-45mins to receive my food."
i only gave this place 2 stars because the wings were a different touch from other pizza places.
the wings at this particular location are first fried then tossed in sauce.
the wait is long but what do you expect for something new... wings are good and the pizza is better than dominos
"i got there a few minutes late on purpose, and my wings were just coming out 5 minutes after my arrival."
"i kind of laughed as i was reading the other reviews of this pizza hut, but yes, this place really is comical in an ""oh god, i can't believe i'm about to eat this"" kind of way.rus walked in and ordered 8 wings and cheesy bread (didn't even get a pizza)."
i ordered a large two topping pizza and boneless sauced wings.
the wings barely had sauce and the pizza had less cheese than the wings had sauce.
"me: "" i would like a caesar salad""pizza hut lady: ""were out of salad""me: "" ok let me get an order of mild wings""pizza hut lady: "" we're out of wings too""me:"
"now i live on the 7 minutes walking from this place, and my pizza and wings were both cold."
i tried to explain numerous times that i've order the special pan pizza with 4 bone out wings but she over talked me every chance she got.
my order came in late and was missing my order of wings.
the driver had the nerve to say they forgot to put my wings in the bag and that i have to call them to send another driver to deliver.
"i called, the manager said we will get the wings within 20 minutes... 30 minutes later i had to call back..."
finally the same driver came back with an attitude and of course the wings were cold!
pizza and wings are so simple as you use tons of frozen product!
"it took them another three minutes to check, only to find out my food was ready and i saw the bowl of wings sitting in the waiting area when i first entered the store."
the wings did not taste as good as they should've.
"i wish i could give this place one star , ordered boneless wings which were undercooked proceeded to order the marshmallow brownie which took 30 mins to come out ( made us miss our movie) than when rajatt brought it out , your local pizza hut manager he didn't bring us forks."
"get some boneless buffalo wings, a pie, and call it a day."
they gave us a chicken wings without sauces.
"i ordered garlic chicken wings, and the wife ordered a small pizza and some bread sticks."
"when you want to eat some wings and pizza together, dont eat here."
"but the wings were dry af, the pizza was completely soft and didn't have the garlic buttery blend crust i always get on my pizza & the marinara sauce was completely watered down."
just ordered here today for the first time i asked for honey bbq wings for me and pizza for my friends( keep in mind the delivery guy got a $10 tip).
they said okay and when i got the the order they gave me spicy wings.
i called them back and the manager said they only have mild or spicy wings which they did not say on the phone honey bbq is spicy .
he said we can give you credit and i said i didnt have anything to eat all day i just want my wings ..can you send me mild and i'll give u back the spicy.
i'm hungry and can't eat the pizza my friends ordered bc i'm allergic to cheese..finally he said he will bring the wings and they never came!!
entered the store 5 minutes early and my food was ready!thank you for really cold large pie pizza.thank you for 3 of the slices missing a lot of toppings.thank you for lack of cheese.thank you for burnt black chicken wings.thank you for not adding hot sauce as i ordered.i'm mostly thankful for the cashier not bagging my food and watched me bag it.please do not mess around and have conversations (3 employees including the manager) when there's a long line of customers especially in front of the register area.
i placed an order today 2- 8 piece wings (simple..
dear ph- don't think you're going to walk up my steps with luke warm wings 30 mins late.
i like my wings fresh and crunchy.
"ordered via the pizza hut app: 9:35pmstated estimated delivery time: 10:04pmcalled to follow up: 10:17pmphone rep stated driver had already left.received call from driver: 10:41pmordered 1 stuffed crust pie, 16 wings, and the chocolate cookie pie.chocolate cookie pie was not warm when received."
so i kept the other order and might i say thank you for the extra wings and pizza.
ordered a large ultimate cheese pie & 16pc boneless garlic parmesan wings.
"i ordered a medium pizza, topped with chicken, onions, and mushroom....i started off though with plain buffalo wings no sauce...they were boneless, more like popcorn chicken."
"we got the special that event, 1 large pie with 1 topping and 1 order of wings for 19$ (as per my so craving pizza hut for some odd reason) we got their deep dish with chicken and mild buffalo boneless wings."
the wings kind of remind me of a knock off buffalo wild wings.
"we ordered buffalo, wings barbecue wings, and garlic parmesan wings, and it taste like crap and smell like poop."
it seems that whoever toss the wings did not wash their hand.
we ordered 2 different flavor wings.
i wanted wings but was told the machine was broken after i had my heart set on them.
"i didn't have time to argue, so i paid $3 for a ranch cup, a blue cheese cup and a cup of marinara for my breadsticks and wings."
"my 16 piece wings were supposed to be in blazin buffalo sauce, and were ""naked"" boneless wings with a pool of sauce at the bottom of the container."
"my wings look like crap, and my pizza had no toppings i paid $40 for a combo and never received my 2 liter soda."
i ordered a 2-topping large pizza and 8 pieces of bone-out wings.
"when i arrived to pick them up, i was given a 1-topping pizza and 6 pieces of bone-in wings."
the thin crust and bone-out wings are crunchy with every single bite.
"i ordered a large pizza, wings, and two pastas but they gave me no napkins or chili flakes or grated cheese."
"today i ordered a customized pan size pizza, wings, & fries."
the wings were okay.
pizza is good when it's good and wings are usually cooked very well.
i ordered 2 med pizzas a cookie and hot wings.
but the worst thing was the chicken wings!
pizza hut chicken wings have always been the best chicken wings ever.
i looked at the wings (thankfully) before i ate them and they were full of feathers!
have i seen chicken wings that still had many many!
it was definitely the most disgusting experience i have ever had with pizza hut and it also ruined my desire to eat chicken wings.
i had to show her on my phone what i had ordered even though she was holding the receipt in her hand and i had to remind her of the wings i ordered also.
i absolutely love the pizza hut wings in the buffalo hot flavor.
"i always loved their wing sauce, but a few years back their wings sucked!"
"you could tell they were frozen wings and not fresh, you know the kind with all the brown yuk all over them, but eventually they upgraded them to larger and fresher wings, and i've been hooked ever since."
with the upgraded wings came an upgraded price.
"now the wings are $1 per wing plus tax, no combos included so it's definitely steep for fast food."
"pizza is hot and wings are ""burnin""."
"i tried the pizza, wings, potato fries and brownie desert.each of the entrées was extremely salty and the desert was sub par to say the least."
"i ordered a pizza and some wings around 1:30 pm, thinking it would be a nice treat on my birthday."
"granted we live less than a mile away, but dang if i wasn't about to take a shower when the doorbell rang!about their wings (i'm a big wing fan & from near buffalo, ny): if you like boneless, cool, go for it."
"i personally prefer ""real"" bone-in wings (but since i'm a minority in my family, i rarely win - but tonight i ""won"")."
"but, the bone-in wings were of a decent size and interestingly more positively memorable than our order from buffalo wild wings (& less expensive to boot!"
"i tried ""wingstreet"" here a couple nights ago, taking out 10 ""burnin' hot"" wings and cheesy breads for about $11."
"i chose ""traditional"" wings, though breaded ""bone-in"" and boneless ""bone-out"" are also available."
"wings are midsized and cooked right, with plenty of sauce."
"it's only hot when it's really accumulated on the wings, and then in the neighborhood of hotter at wing zone or bam at ba-da-wings of chapel hill, north carolina."
must go through before launching a new food product - let alone a new brand - wingstreet is poorly executed.
"i sought to use a coupon for 20 wings at $10.99, but you can't mix flavors, and who wants 20 wings of the same flavor on their first visit to a wing joint."
