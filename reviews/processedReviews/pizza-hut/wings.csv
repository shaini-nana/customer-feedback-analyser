we never got our wings.
"!i ordered 36 wings and cheesy bread, once i got the wings in my car it smelled like sweaty gym socksi called the store and spoke with the manager and received no sort of remorse, sympathy, nothing, she told me it's nothing she could do!"
after a 20 minute wait i receive my order only to find out that their are wings missing .
after explaining to her that i ordered wings she proceeds to tell me that i did not and if i would like some to pay again .
we also ordered the wing street buffalo wings which were not bad...def a break back into childhood memories!
now their traditional hot wings are insanely huge and taste differently.
"we have a better deal 2 large pizza with any topping and wings for 25$"" i said ohh ok i'll get that .. my husband went to get the pizza and payed 39$ why!!!!!!!!!!"
"whatever you do, avoid the boneless wings at all costs."
i've given this place several chances and every time i order the boneless wings they are always undercooked.
their wings are ok but over priced imo.
"hi there yelpers, i haven't been to this pizza hut in years and finally today 3/6/20 we decided to get a large pie with pineapple, a large pie with pepperoni and an order of 12 honey bqe bone in chicken wings."
the only reason they get two stars in this review is because of the empty and convenient parking lot and because the wings were good.
"how they call this buffalo wings , they look like pigeon wings."
"food (medium supreme pizza, medium cheese pizza, and 8 wings) arrived within a reasonable time."
wings at pizza hut are actually not bad.
sriracha honey wings are actually something i would order again.
"special deal :the big box dinner which is 2 medium one topping pizzas, one side order(wings, pasta or pizza rollers) and bread/cheese sticks for $22.85 after tax."
buffalo wings and breadsticks are great too.
"love the wings here, would come alone just for that if their cheesy crust pizza wasn't so darn good!."
we waited for 30 mins for some bread and wings...bread and wings!!
"the conversation went like this: "" can i have extra blue cheese with my wings"" and he responds "" nah""."
"uh i ordered wings dude"", he hangs up on me, but not before he makes some racist comments."
their wings are ok but over priced imo.
"ehhh i usually order for delivery, but for some reason it always takes them more than an hr to deliver a pizza and some wings and by the time it gets to me its already cold."
so it was sunday around 3pm and i usually get dominos because of the wings but i decided to get pizza hut because my fiancé loves it.
when i placed my order with this location i was expecting to receive 8 breaded wings.
upon receiving my order i received 8 boneless wings.
the wings were highly un satisfying in the sense that they were tough and slightly burnt.
we literally waited close to 1.5 hours for two medium pizzas and an order of eight bone in wings.
pizza and wings were fantastic.
the girl at the register was super polite and even gave my extra sauce for my chicken wings.
"i ordered a large pizza with 5 toppings, stuffed garlic knots, buffalo wings and a cookie pie thing and everything was fresh, hot and delicious."
they got a 5$ deal going on and what not so i ordered me a hand tossed pepperoni and pineapple pizza with bbq and medium buffalo wings .
and don't get me started on my uncooked boneless wings .
omg was so excited that pizza hut finally opened in my area ..... the pizza was not up to standard it tasted like a knockoff frozen pizza the bread was very thick and  very dry the wings horrible i will stay with papa johns or dominoes
"bread sticks and wings, i was informed that the wait will be 30mins-45mins to receive my food."
i only gave this place 2 stars because the wings were a different touch from other pizza places.
the wings at this particular location are first fried then tossed in sauce.
the wait is long but what do you expect for something new... wings are good and the pizza is better than dominos
"i got there a few minutes late on purpose, and my wings were just coming out 5 minutes after my arrival."
"i kind of laughed as i was reading the other reviews of this pizza hut, but yes, this place really is comical in an ""oh god, i can't believe i'm about to eat this"" kind of way.rus walked in and ordered 8 wings and cheesy bread (didn't even get a pizza)."
i ordered a large two topping pizza and boneless sauced wings.
the wings barely had sauce and the pizza had less cheese than the wings had sauce.
"me: "" i would like a caesar salad""pizza hut lady: ""were out of salad""me: "" ok let me get an order of mild wings""pizza hut lady: "" we're out of wings too""me:"
"now i live on the 7 minutes walking from this place, and my pizza and wings were both cold."
i tried to explain numerous times that i've order the special pan pizza with 4 bone out wings but she over talked me every chance she got.
my order came in late and was missing my order of wings.
the driver had the nerve to say they forgot to put my wings in the bag and that i have to call them to send another driver to deliver.
"i called, the manager said we will get the wings within 20 minutes... 30 minutes later i had to call back..."
finally the same driver came back with an attitude and of course the wings were cold!
pizza and wings are so simple as you use tons of frozen product!
"it took them another three minutes to check, only to find out my food was ready and i saw the bowl of wings sitting in the waiting area when i first entered the store."
the wings did not taste as good as they should've.
"i wish i could give this place one star , ordered boneless wings which were undercooked proceeded to order the marshmallow brownie which took 30 mins to come out ( made us miss our movie) than when rajatt brought it out , your local pizza hut manager he didn't bring us forks."
"get some boneless buffalo wings, a pie, and call it a day."
they gave us a chicken wings without sauces.
"i ordered garlic chicken wings, and the wife ordered a small pizza and some bread sticks."
"when you want to eat some wings and pizza together, dont eat here."
"but the wings were dry af, the pizza was completely soft and didn't have the garlic buttery blend crust i always get on my pizza & the marinara sauce was completely watered down."
just ordered here today for the first time i asked for honey bbq wings for me and pizza for my friends( keep in mind the delivery guy got a $10 tip).
they said okay and when i got the the order they gave me spicy wings.
i called them back and the manager said they only have mild or spicy wings which they did not say on the phone honey bbq is spicy .
he said we can give you credit and i said i didnt have anything to eat all day i just want my wings ..can you send me mild and i'll give u back the spicy.
i'm hungry and can't eat the pizza my friends ordered bc i'm allergic to cheese..finally he said he will bring the wings and they never came!!
entered the store 5 minutes early and my food was ready!thank you for really cold large pie pizza.thank you for 3 of the slices missing a lot of toppings.thank you for lack of cheese.thank you for burnt black chicken wings.thank you for not adding hot sauce as i ordered.i'm mostly thankful for the cashier not bagging my food and watched me bag it.please do not mess around and have conversations (3 employees including the manager) when there's a long line of customers especially in front of the register area.
i placed an order today 2- 8 piece wings (simple..
dear ph- don't think you're going to walk up my steps with luke warm wings 30 mins late.
i like my wings fresh and crunchy.
"ordered via the pizza hut app: 9:35pmstated estimated delivery time: 10:04pmcalled to follow up: 10:17pmphone rep stated driver had already left.received call from driver: 10:41pmordered 1 stuffed crust pie, 16 wings, and the chocolate cookie pie.chocolate cookie pie was not warm when received."
so i kept the other order and might i say thank you for the extra wings and pizza.
ordered a large ultimate cheese pie & 16pc boneless garlic parmesan wings.
