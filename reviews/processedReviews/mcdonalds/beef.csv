the double beef cheese burger is probably the best thing in the planet
did you know that one breakfast sandwich has all the suggested days worth of calories.... did you know they cook their fries in fake beef some kinda whatever oil?
it actually tastes like you're eating grade d beef which is criminal.
"mcdonald's is never my first choice, but it's usually one of the few eateries that is open by 7am (even on a saturday).after reviewing the menu, i got to the order counter and asked whether the sausage was beef/pork/blend."
