"however like any mcdonald place, it's mcdonald's and the burgers are great, the fries are great, and it's a favorite to all the kids."
"scale of 1-10:food: 4service: 0atmosphere: 1dinner for 2 people (plus tax): $15favorite dish: value meal #7pros:-it's mcdonald's, if you like fast food you'll probably like the food regardless of how incompetent the staff is-open late or 24 hours, i forget which-they gave us a free order of fries after we waited 25 minutes for a filet o' fish sandwichcons:-worst service in the city, hands down, and that is saying a lot."

"i ordered the $2.50 double combo which is a double cheeseburger and small fries, the double cheeseburger had 2 slices of cheese , one each over each burger patty,  it was actually melted."
did you know that one breakfast sandwich has all the suggested days worth of calories.... did you know they cook their fries in fake beef some kinda whatever oil?
did you know that their fries won't grow mold...which means that it won't digest in your stomach.... sort of like a twinkie....did you know that the use all parts of the chicken including but not limited to the beak and feet...do you really want to eat that?
"(***)i wouldn't recommend these fries, it wasn't hot nor was it crispy."
as a compensation they offered to give me an extra large fries and apple pie.
this mcdonalds has to be the fucking worst of the worst how is that you get my order wrong every single time like lwgit every time i ask for no salt fries i get old stale fries with salt im missing a fucking drink and you burn my nuggets like i dont understand .
the small fries there is already 222 calories!
however the fries are pretty good.
mcdonald's in my opinion have the best fries compare to the other fast food place.
"when they're busy they will pull out fried food (nuggets, french fries, etc) before they're done because the workers don't want to wait for the food to be finished."
the nuggets and fries literally had bits of ice on them.
"the fries are good, big macs good, i've still never eaten a filet-o-fish."
"although i am blitzed on sour, the burger is uncharacteristically juicy and hot..the fries as fresh as possible."

"no joy to be had here however, brace yourself for sawdust fries and dried out pickles - this place is best summed up by a ringing endorsment known as ""meh..."""
"friendly staff, always amenable to making me a fresh batch of fries, convenient corner location near my house and multiple schools, and large, clean seating area."
"i've never had an order go awry here, granted all i usually get is the $1 large fries via the app."
"they were pretty clean as well.on my visit, i got their fries and a fish filet sandwich, which were both pretty fresh and tasty."

the fries were solid and as memorable as i remember them being.
(luckily i didn't get a meal and just fries and an oatmeal).
"to add insult to injury, my fries were luke warm and dry as hell."
on 2/20/20 @ 6:10 i observed the young lady at the fries stand opening the fries sleeve with her bare hands and then knocking the extra fries back into the tray with her bare hands.
large fries mcdonald are a lot more than what i remember the price to be.
then when you finally get your order 10-30 mins later.... you find they been modifying the fries to accept less fries....
"i'm done with this place after last night waiting nearly 15 minutes for an order of fries (a crazy pregnancy craving, it's all i can eat and keep down!)"
this is the flagship mcdonalds... why are they so stingy with the fries?!
this mickey d's is supposed to be the pinnacle of mcdonalds and they always short change you on the french fries and the air conditioning seems totally nonexistent.
fries cold.
it took me north of 8 minutes to get an order of fries and soda.
bad service and the fries are always under undercooked.
"do not go after midnight, food is not fresh i just threw up my chicken sandwich.. and for the past week they did not clean their oil that they cook their fries in!"
black stuff all over fries it looks like black pepper but it's not it from old grease!
i ordered 2 chicken tenders and a small order of french fries.
so did the french fries actually.
got a fresh batch of french fries but they were somehow soggy too!
"food is rarely fresh, never got good tasting fries in this mcdonald's."
"i order nothing but a small fries, wait 10-15 mins...i should have asked a lot sooner, but at that point i asked: what's going on with the fries?the lady says (direct quote) ""why didn't you say something?"""
"and starts cooking fries at that moment, literally 15 minutes after i ordered.unreal."
"i walked into this downtown mcdonald's on a friday evening to find the usual scene: a few couples grabbing a quick bite, some teenagers getting ready for a night on the town, and a dead man sitting in a booth by the window.i got in line, which went fairly quickly, ordering a ten piece mcnugget meal with fries and a dr. pepper."
"gene's final meal was spread out over the table in front of him: medium fries, a soda, ten piece mcnuggets and barbecue sauce."
"i could barely get the fry down my throat, you best believe i did not touch the fries after that first one."
"they didn't have fries though at this time, and breakfast items took at least 15 minutes"
"minus the fact it took 15 minutes to get a single burger with no drink, fries, etc."
fries are often cold.
"i asked for 1 large fries, 1 small fries, 1 large soda and 1 mcchicken."
"when the cashier hand me the receipt, it says ""2 large fries, and 1 large soda."
"i told the cashier that i only order 1 large fries, not 2, and i also ordered mcchicken but it's not on my receipt."
"burger fries and drink these are staples and should be on stand by""  the idiot looked at the food area and handed it to me."
"i'll frequent the golden arches for their soft serve, apple pies, and fries any day.this location needs help, if corporate is listening, please send 1-20 people."
"one time- while finally being able to order and already paid -the cashier got everything ready except for my fries and walked off saying that more needed to be made, which was true."
then other cashiers went there to get fries.
i told one of them that all i needed was a large fries in my order and asked whether they could help me out because my cashier was nowhere to be found.
"""when my cashier finally returned, the same cashier specifically wouldn't let her get any fries."
so i had to wait for that cashier to eventually use up all the fries and for another batch to be made.this place is beyond appalling.
i waited forever for a ten piece nuggets and fries.
my fries were soaked with grease and inedible!
"i am thankfully not homeless, but i have come here out of shame and desperation, which is often accompanied by its own special vacancy otherwise reserved for self-respect.a few times a year, something stirs inside me that can only be satiated with greasy chicken mcnuggets and an over-salted order of large fries, and no matter how many other lunch spots i try to visit first, deep down, i know i'm always going to end up at this here mickey dee's."
"and lastly, they always give you half the fries bag full."
"dear mcdonald's,how is your cashier selling me a meal only for me to learn - after paying her - from the employee responsible for handing orders to customers waiting in the pick-up area/line, that there are no more fries at effing all on your property?"
the customers ahead of me had been waiting on their fries for a long time and were getting impatient and angry.
"hard, cold, old french fries every time."
i ordered mcnuggets and fries and a shake.
the nuggets and shake were good but the fries were too crispy for my liking.
she wanted fries.
"ok, i can get fries."
"i had a very simple order: one double cheeseburger, one fish sandwich, one order medium fries, one large coke."
"i go to mcdonald's to order my food and i have noticed that there was a young guy making fries with no gloves.i ask the supervisor and she told me that ""he not dealing with raw food,that why he not wearing gloves,he washing his hands every 30mins""."
i put a mobile order in for 20 piece spicy nuggets and fries which i got correctly but got all the sauces i ordered wrong!.
"usually the deal will reappear once you step outside the store but on occasion, we'd have to walk a block just to get our $1 fries."
"i know this sounds crazy, but my roommate and i wanted to do a eating contest last night so we each had to eat 40 mcnuggets, 1 mcdouble, and an order of fries."
the only good thing was the fries.
"(you guys may want to petition sam to take away my elite status for that last statement).anyway, for those who stroll into mcd's because of the power of my persuasive yelp review all intent on ordering a yogurt parfait but then smell the fries and feel the temptation to order something else, please feast your eyes on the following calorie and fat numbers culled from mcd's own website:quarter pounder with cheese:  510 calories, 230 from fatgrilled chicken club: 570 calories, 190 from fatlarge fries:  570 calories, 270 from fatsouthwest salad w/ chicken (it's a fucking 400 calorie salad!!"
but the fries at this mcdonald's are cheaper than most in manhattan.
"chicken mcnuuuuugetts (to be sung in an off-key, screechy voice, preferably drunk)chicken mcnuuuuuugettsyou will always be theeeere for me.wherever i go, anyblock in the ciiiity,whenever i'm hungry, especially night,i only need to look for golden arches.there's the long wait in line,the pale fluorescent light,the red yellow interior design,the fake plants,and of course, the dredges and drunkardsof the night,both in front and behind the counnnnnter.but however distasteful,however disgraceful,however.....well, just nastyyyyy,i will always return for your nuuuuugets.those tasty little golden things,full of chicken tasting material,juicy, tender, and hot,and how about that sweeeeet and souuurrr sauce!ten to a box, i usually takesometimes even twenty.once i did fifty,plus two large fries and drinks!that was in chicago,though it was not on the menu,it was on their register machine,a speakeasy sorrrrrt of thing.i could probably eat more, i'm too scarrred to find out how much,but i'm sure its a lot.please don't judge me,it's just that these things,are so damn tasty,i love me some nuuuuugettz!chicken mcnuuuuuugettsyou will always be theeeere for me.wherever i go, anyblock in the ciiiity,whenever i'm hungry, especially night,i only need to look for golden arches."
"you should really stop eating this stuff.. but if you must and can deal with the occasional pan handlers holding the doors for you out front and the herds of obnoxious teenagers from neighboring schools then come on by and get a ""fresh"" batch of fries."
apparently it's a place to get robbed and shot at but maybe that's just halloween... still love the fries.
i love nuggets and fries from mcdonald's but this mcdonald's is just okay.
i mean its the signature sandwich... on top of that both fries were cold and bland.
management  needs to look at this.the fries were barely warm not hot and the fish sandwich was overcooked.couldn't go back .i was there from 10:05 -10:30.
"the french fries, unfortunately, were quite awful."
food is always hot and fries are always fresh!
you really expect me to eat fries anywhere else?
