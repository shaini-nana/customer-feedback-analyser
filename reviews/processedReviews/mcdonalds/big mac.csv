"'table' service (ha ha ha) (i think they got rid of this)lol and to top it all off the frickin' homeless come in here to chill, adding to the high class atmosphere and ambience you're supposed to be getting with your fries and big mac."
"crazy busy, minimal control over the lines/wait, and over 140 seats upstairs (literally there's a sign at the door for that).2 big macs for $5 right now (sandwiches only)."
big macs that barely look like big macs.
"the fries are good, big macs good, i've still never eaten a filet-o-fish."
there was a cockroach crawling on the wall when i was trying to enjoy my big mac and a large cok.
spent 20 minutes waiting for 2 big macs.
ordered double big mac.
however my friend and i stop here for the buy one get one free big mac deal during memorial day weekend since both of us didn't have one in years.
the major reason that i give this place four stars is the quality of the big mac.
"this felt like i would be ordering a big mac from a dirty, subway bathroom stall."
"of course, i didn't really need a groundbreaking documentary to ameliorate me in making a correlation between my girth and my love of big macs."
they have fucked up every order i have gotten from there.how do you fuck up the big mac?!?!?!
"while i can hardly fault the restaurant for that, it certainly didn't impress me.i ordered a big mac, seeking the thrill and relief i see in the commercials when people eat this burger."
