"1|2|This place is a sad excuse for a subway. Seriously pathetic every time I visit. First and foremost today I went before work and the lady working was asked about a coupon, from the lady behind me, while she was making my sub. She had gloves on and then grabbed the coupon from this customer. Looked at it a few times, handed it back and touched my sub and continued to make it with her contaminated glove. EXTREMELY unacceptable. This is common sense. In any matter, I am a certified food manager therefore I know exactly what is a violation of heath codes and what is not. What's even worse is that when I asked her to change her glove she got upset with me. Seriously?Another time I came in one evening and the store was empty. I stood at the front for 10 minutes. TEN. I literally had to call the store to have the young kid in back pick the phone up extremely unprofessionally to come and do his job. Does this subway not have management?I've called corporate before and was told that this subway location didn't exist. Well it definitely does unfortunately. It needs to be non existent. That's for sure. I will be contacting the corporate office again because this place is a joke. Avoid at all costs."
"2|2|never patronize this location again. I'm furious with the unsafe food handling and the unbelievably unacceptable behavior of the employees. They lack training in safe food handling practices, it's not acceptable to serve ice cold meat in subs that are supposed to be hot, prepared and served at a safe and appropriate temperature.  I called the location, asked the young man his name (Lakota)  and asked if there was a manager available, he replied ""there is no manager here "" I proceeded to tell him about our experience, and his reply was "" I'm not going to sit here on the phone and listen to you complain"" He hung up on me!??? WTAF!! I had him on speaker phone and my husband heard this utterly unacceptable disrespectful response, I hadn't raised my voice,  I hadn't been rude, I fully expected an ""oh I'm sorry that happened, I'd be happy to remake the sub, or any apology or option to make it right. This kid clearly doesn't give a rats ass about customer service, safe food handling, or representing the owner of this franchise location. My husband went to get subs for dinner , they had zero meatballs, husband asked how long would it be until they would be ready, he went to his vehicle waited 15 minutes and returned to place his order. He felt my sub and asked ""are you sure this is hot""? Lakota replied yes. I took one bite of the sub and the meatballs were ice cold ! This is unsafe food handling and should never have been served. I immediately called the corporate offices to lodge my complaint, in which I eagerly await to speak with the owner. Wether it's poor training. poor hiring, or what have you, the behavior of this employee is unsafe and disrespectful. Please do not give your business and your hard earned money to this location, until their training is rectified. If I can save one person from experiencing what we just did, all of the time I just spent on the phone, on this site,  writing this review etc will be worth it. Zero stars"
3|1|Subway is good for your heart there's no fried foods all healthy always fresh nice and friendly customer service. Usually clean store and restrooms but it's hard for one person to take customer's orders and clean and maintain the store
4|2|I just saw the nasty thing I saw a guy touching money then started making food as people should know that money is the dirtiest thing so I  turned around and walked out
5|1|Subway eat freash! Always good food!
"6|1|Looking for a Subway with an international flair?? Stop in at this sandwich shop! The same sandwiches as all the others, but I promise that you will meet new people, perhaps learn a little bit of Spanish (or any other language), and leave with a smile. I love this place...primarily because of the friendly staff and people watching."
"7|1|Of course subway is a chain restaurant and they're all very very consistent, but I had to come and leave a review due to the great employees and how friendly they were.  The sandwich was just as good as other subways, but I always but a CRAP load of stuff on my sandwich and at a lot of subways people always get annoyed or pissed off that I'm asking for all this stuff (Like its a act of god to do their job)Anyway, the employees here were perfectly fine with bending over backwards to fulfill my sandwich needs!Thanks!!!"
"8|2|You still need to provide customer service in the morning.  No hello, no thank you, no smile.  I been in there twice to grab food on the way to work and I regret.  The food is Subway food but for some reason no one who works there cares."
"9|1|Everything you expect from a subway. Food is fine. Workers are friendly. Fast, cheap, healthy food."
"10|2|If I could give this location zero stars I definitely would.  Staff was rude and unprofessional. Me and my friend were inside ordering our food and then they received an online or door dash order and stopped in the middle of our order to complete the online order. My friend questioned this and the staff got rude & sassy.  In addition to this, the employee did not change gloves when making the sandwiches. (Online order was tuna) . Once we expressed the concerns to the manager he was rude and told us to ""stop giving his employee a hard time"". Won't return to this location"
11|2|Sign was on indicating it was opened. The time was already passed nine in the morning. An employee came out and said it won't be open for another 30 minutes. Seriously?! Come earlier to work!
"12|2|Don't eat here if you want to get your food within 15 minutes...or even a half hour! We waited and waited, but ended up just leaving. The crazy part is that there were 4 people behind the counter! Never going to this location again."
"13|2|Visited this subway last night. Upon my arrival, one of the male employees was talking to a female employee. He was saying how we wanted to fight someone and give them a black eye, and he dropped the ""f bomb"" about 10 times. While I was ordering, a car pulled up outside and he said ""goddamn, go home people! Go cook for yourselves because I don't wanna serve your asses."" Then, when we got to the part where I add veggies to my sub, I asked for spinach and he put lettuce on my sub. When I corrected him, he said ""it all tastes the damn same"" under his breath but loud enough for me to hear. Unacceptable customer service, even for a subway in the ghetto. This subway is disgrace to all subways."

"19|2|There is something nostalgic about eating a sandwich you ate when you were 9. That's what keeps me coming back a few times a year. Not all Subways are created equal and the tomatoes are never ripe but you go anyway. The sandwich artist who took care of me today took his time and was quite careful and consideration was put into placing each piece of cheese and veg, also provided more than 5 black olive slices and I appreciate that. The place was clean and tidy. Location is in a Walmart, so there's that. Overall, it's Subway, tastes just as it always does, alright."
"20|2|This is the Subway in Walmart. The food was okay, but the dining area didn't have one clean table, the trash was overflowing and the beverage center was not stocked and wasn't clean. There was a young man and an older woman working. The guy made my sandwich, but the woman wrapped it and put in the bag (without washing her hands or putting on gloves).  The woman also seemed more concerned about whatever was happening on her phone than she did about taking care of customers. They both took turns sitting on a chair behind the counter next to the wall to play on their phones. I've worked on restaurants and have been a manager in restaurants. This type of laziness would not have been tolerated of me or my employees. My visit was on 10/06/18 at around 12:20pm. I was in the restaurant for abou a half hour."
"21|2|This Subway is inside Walmart.   I wasn't expecting gourmet food, its a Subway.   I was expecting for my meatball sub to be warm.   They didn't heat up the meatballs.   Who eats cold meatballs?    They asked me 4 times if I wanted the sandwich toasted--no, just heated up.   Guess they don't understand that concept.   The dining area while small was dirty.   Tables not cleaned off-we had to do that ourselves.  The beverage stand had trash and hadn't been wiped down as there was pop on the counter that things were sticking too.   I tried to fill out their online questionnaire and found that leaving a negative review isn't possible.  I tried to indicate how I really felt the food ranked and the review site wouldn't allow that to be put thru unless I indicated it was higher than a 5.   What good is that-they arnt getting peoples real opinions.  They sent me a code for a free cookie....if I go back to the same Subway.  Not going to happen."
"22|1|I want to give a 5 star shout out to the girl working the counter today! I just watched her deal with some pretty obnoxious stuff (including a declined card after the food was already prepared) and she handled it with a professional and positive attitude. I can only imagine the things she deals with working in a Walmart Subway on a daily basis, so thank you! My sandwich is delish, and you showed that you not only care about your job, but the people you serve!"
"23|2|The worst,got a long hair in my sandwich,said something,got 3 bucks and mocked on way out!will NEVER  go again,can still feel the hair in my mouth,at least it wasn't short and curly....."
"24|3|They sell generic subs.But hey, it's a great cure for a hangover, or a quick lunch if you forgot it!"
25|2|Came here before a movie for a quick bite. I like Subway somewhat and it is filling.They have a decent amount of people working which is nice. They got through the lines are fast they could.Food was okay but not great. Subway has been disappointing me for some time now.The bathrooms were kind of gross too which I wasn't happy with. Some of the tables were dirty. Overall not a terrible experience but not great.They do have a drive thru at this location which is good to know!
"26|1|They made my order incorrect upon ordering through drive thru. When I went into the store to correct the order the gentleman who helped me on 12/14/2019 was very professional, friendly, understanding, and quick to correct the mistake. Even though it was incorrect at first I understand we all can make mistakes, especially when busy! It was the swiftness and professionalism shown by the employees that I give a 5 star review. These traits and hard to come by in employees and your location should be proud of their employees! Thank you!"
27|3|Stopped in here for the first time recently and was surprised to see they have a drive-thru!  I have never seen that at a Subway!  I walked inside to order anyway and got my usual veggie with all the fixings on flat bread and it was delicious!  Line went fast and employees were nice!  If I am in the area I will definitely stop in again.
"28|2|So first experience there was poor but wanted to give them another chance. Just like our first experience the Table's were dirty, floor a mess, employee's all looked/acted like they hate there job and are unfriendly. Think there were about 3 working and as soon as the small line of customers were done they all disappeared into the back. No cleaning off tables or cleaning at all. Hopefully the franchise owner reads this and solves this so he/she can get some business back."
29|2|Went through the drive-thru and Ordered three subs they charged me for and Italian BMT but gave me a ham.None of the other ingredients on the sub we're correct either.  unfortunately I was taking it to somebody over in Roseville and did not realize The mistake until I was in Roseville. . when I called Subway to tell somebody about the error they just basically said come in and we will give you the price difference. He did not apologize for the air no I did then anyway want to compensate for the fact that someone got the wrong sub and didn't even like it.
"30|2|Absolutely disgusted, went there around 10am, so hey had only been open for 2 hours. My 4 year old said she had to use the bathroom. I was there alone so I took her to the men's room. Piss and pubes all over he toilet, garbage overflowing in floor, looks like it had not been cleaned for days. Daughter refused to use the toilet In there. So since it's a single bathroom, I looked in woman's room. Same thing. Garbage outside restarunt also overflowing. They had not been open for long. Highly unlikely he mess was just from today. If they don't clean the public places everyone sees, I would hate to see the back of house. Will not be returning to this subway."
31|2|Just ok. Service is not that great. Some jerk wads making subs though. They talk too much! This place is next to a movie theater and the fast food joints are a half mile to the east.
"32|2|Went in this afternoon, one girl was working behind the counter, and was ringing up two customers, and another was waiting to have their order taken. It took 5 minutes or so to ring up those two up. After she did, I saw she had her cell phone to her ear, like she was checking a voice message. After a minute or so, still hadn't taken the order for the guy ahead of me, I walked out and went elsewhere. She didn't have any sense of urgency This was my third or so visit to this particular  location and service has always been slow. Either because they are understaffed, or they just want to take their sweet time. I am not planning to come back to this location, too many other options nearby"
33|2|I think Brooklyn Center has the worst customer service I've ever experienced.  No matter the restaurant it's all horrible and subway tonight proved me to be more right. How can you tell customers as they walk in you only have wheat and white bread available...then my bf gets the wheat and it's the only one (already split in the middle cause someone messed up) so I can't have it...in conclusion the worker there tonight was EXTRA LAZY.
"34|3|I planned to meet a gf for a quick sammich and conversation.. and she suggested Subway in North Mpls on Penn Avenue N and Lowry (located on the corner within the strip Mall).Parking appeared complicated, due to Penn Ave being shut down on Penn Ave from Lowry, heading into dtwn, and all of the construction taking place.  However, parking was easy.  There is a lot behind the strip mall, in the shared lot for Aldi's and the Dollar Store.  There is also street parking on Lowry, there is a indented area right in front of the new building... in front of the bus stop and on the other side of Lowry also.Ambiance:The store was clean, there were a few other customers there (one couple eating and a few coming in to order food and a couple of people just to try and get water).  I was bothered that there was no restroom to wash my hands, nor any hand sanitizer to accommodate the lack of a restroom.  It's a food establishment... i want clean hands to eat. *insert funky face*Service:The gentleman who was working, I presumed to be an owner.  He was friendly and attentive and quick with our sandwiches.  The only thing that puzzled me was that he did not have water cups for his patrons.  I noticed that some guys congregating outside near the bus stop, not waiting for a bus, kept coming in for water cups and not buying anything, so maybe that's why.  Maybe he ran out or was eliminating unnecessary entries.  HOWEVER, if i paid for a meal, and prefer to not drink soda and not to purchase a bottle of water, a complimentary water would be nice.  I'm just saying.Food:  The food was typical Subway, however, he made the food look soooo pretty.  We asked if hew as a sandwhich artist. LOL It tickled him and he said, ""If you're looking for a sandwhich artist, do not come here.""  I disagree with him though.. he made it look pretty nice.  I'll come back, when I'm in the neighborhood and craving a turkey sammich and have my own water. LOL"
"35|2|I asked for a LOT of black olives on my sandwich and the guy working put a small amount, so I asked for more, he put 2 extra olives again, I asked for more olives he put 2 extra more, I ask for more. He tells me I have to pay extra. Now I worked at Subway for over 2 1/2 years and I have never been told to charge customers for extra vegetables. It's MAKE IT YOUR OWN WAY so if I want extra olives on my sandwich I should be able to have extra olives it's not like I was being rude or mean or difficult I just wanted extra Olives ‼‼"
"36|1|I've been to many Subways over the years from small towns to downtown Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Overall, I had a pleasant experience at this location.Some friends and I picked up sandwiches on the way to Live on the Drive on the parkway. I liked that the sandwich maker made our sandwiches with a bit of a show. I'll be back."
"37|2|Not a big Subway fan but want to review this one because of the good and bad nature of this store.  The food is up to standard for Subway chain stores.  There is one really fantastic sandwich artist here, he is a middle aged Asian guy who doesn't speak English well but understands it just fine.  You can tell he really enjoys his job and has fun doing it.  He is a ""Sandwich Artist"" and makes a great looking (and tasting) sandwich.The remainder of the crew can be slow and many require a lot of pointing and gesturing to get what you want.  I've waited in line long enough so I gave up and walked out."
"38|3|I've been so excited about the new development on Penn and Lowry Aves.  I'm not even normally a fan of Subway, what with their corporate fast food business model and all, but when this opened up I thought it would at least be a place in the neighborhood where people can eat rather than hopping a bus and going halfway downtown to the Gyro place on James Ave.I ate here tonight for the first time.  Here is what went well:The new Buffalo Chicken Sub is spectacular.  They serve Dutch Crunch salt and vinegar chips.  They are within walking distance of my home.  Here is what could have made the experience better:If anyone working here at 6:30 on this Friday evening spoke fluent English.  Seriously, I'm not that xenophobe guy who bitches about this, but at least schedule a manager who can arbitrate customer disputes.  It took me twenty minutes to wait for the guy in front of me to get his sandwich, and then I had to explain for another ten what it was that I wanted.  I give three solid stars because it's nice to have a reliable sandwich artist at my beck and call, but I give only three stars because there is so much room for improvement, both linguistically and parking...ly.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Subway, and I hope you can find a groove that you can sell and we can buy."
"39|2|Go at your own risk.  I live near by and thought I would pop in for a sandwich on a Saturday afternoon.  I like Subway, fresh, sorta healthy all that good stuff.   This place was clean.....enough I guess.  Would never have made it in St. Louis Park, but for North it was clean.  The sandwich guy sorta spoke english.  I had to forgo some of the things I like on my sandwich as he did not understand ""black olives"" but he did smile the whole time, so....      While I was sitting there eating with my friend a big guy who we did not know comes over and plops down at our table and starts to threaten us.  We tell him nicely to go away we don't know you, and he again starts in on how he is going to F*ck one of us up.  We holler over to the counter to have the employee call the cops.  He smiled.    back to our table words go back and forth.  We aske 4 TIMES to call the police.  Finally another customer gets up in this guys face and gets him to leave us alone.   The employee.  still smiling.     I will NEVER walk in there again.  If your staff is not trained enough to know when to call the Police then they should not work there.  If they do not speak enough engligh to understand CALL THE POLICE then they should not work there.             I like the work going on in the area trying to clean it up, but when a business like this does not care enough to make it's customers safe, then are they really adding to the community?"
