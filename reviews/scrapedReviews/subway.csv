1|2|I went to Subway to have a wheat bread tuna and showed up and they were out of every single bread they had 3 Italian breads and 1 flat bread you don't go to Starbucks and get them to tell you oh theres no coffee we ran out would you prefer tea. I say do not go to the Subway it is not good they had no bread you shouldn't run out of bread at a sandwich place
"2|3|This location saddens me because there are two ladies here that are so amazing and set the bar so high and the last two times i went in they weren't the best. Mistakes happen such as i ask for a foot long and you cut the bread to a 6 inch, they are human so it's fine but touching your hair and then trying to touch my sub..oh no. Then while my sub is warming you decided to ring me up with the gloves you were making my sub and then grab money and all and when my sub starts beeping you try to go grab for it...please no. I asked her nicely to again change her gloves and I could feel the energy from her change like she wasn't happy, but honestly I don't want all those germs all over my food. So that turned me off. I also had a visit where I came in late and the girl that was taking the trash out came back in and since the girl that was making my sub realized she didn't have sweet onion sauce she asked the other girl and without washing her hands she grabbed one...I just stated I didn't want any. I am not into lack of cleanliness when it comes to my food. Other than those mishaps the restaurant does normally appear clean. It's located in the shopping center with Food lion. There are also several other places such as a nail shop, vape shop and a dollar general store right there as well."
"3|2|This is the 5th time coming to this Subway. All 5 times the African American girl with her braids twisted up is the most rudest person. There are times to when a the workers have had their friends in the store goofing around and being obnoxious. This employee doesn't greet you. She snaps at you when you ask any question. She doesn't even say your welcome or tell you to have a good afternoon or good evening...This is unacceptable!! She needs to either take a customer service class or be let go.Plus, all 5 times there is always something broken or they dont have it. This store needs to be revamped!!!"
4|2|The worst subway i have ever been to. The place was empty and it took forever to make my sandwich. Staff was trash i will never eat here again.
"5|1|There are two Subways in the area.  The one on Aberdeen Proving Ground and this one.The one on APG gets packed starting at 11 a.m., but this one is nice and empty until about noon-ish, which makes sense because of the civilian workforce's lunch schedule.That said, it's my favorite Subway to go to when I want something.  It's clean, plenty of parking, the people are generally quick, and there's always seating if I want to eat there."
"6|1|The manager and staff are nice to customers and the line moves fast, even when it's a city block long at lunch.  It's the most efficient subway I've been to.  It moves at least twice the speed of most of them, but the long line makes up for the speed.  Order ahead in the morning to save tons of time."
"7|3|Decent subway.  Big line at lunch time, I'd avoid it between 12 and 1"
"8|1|The friendliest staff I've ever met at a Subway. The younger girl was extremely nice. I would highly recomend the location. The steak, egg and cheese on 9 grain bread was awesome."
"9|2|Ordered online and showed up a couple minutes after the order was supposed to be complete. One girl working is eating a sandwich, the other girl asks did an online order come in? Girl eating says, yeah, and continues eating her sandwich while the other girl finally starts our order. Once they start they continue to give condescending looks like I'm disrupting their day.... at 1pm on a weekend at a lunch spot. Don't order from here, plenty of other good lunch locations around."
"10|2|Not my best experience with a BLT. A rookie sandwich maker, had to tell how to make the sandwich. Just visiting, stay away"
"11|2|Awful experience today. Trying to order three meal sandwiches and first: they had no cheddar cheese. Oh well, tried asking for Swiss and... NO, they didn't have any Swiss either. Had to go with provolone ‍Second act: One of the sandwiches I wanted to order was meatball, but they didn't have any meatballs, so I had to order chicken teriyaki instead. 3rd act: I wanted a cookie and GUESS WHAT?!? The cookies were in the oven. When I asked how long before they were ready, I was told I had to wait an hour... AN HOUR TO BAKE COOKIES!!! Really?!? (It doesn't take that long to bake cookies and PLEASE have someone prove me wrong on this one!!)This was a few minutes after 7pm. Not even rush hour and the store had only a couple of customers inside andIn front of me there was only one person who was also dealing with them not having most products available. Last but not least, the employees were very unprofessional, and playing/joking around making fun of the customer in front of me while she was ordering."
"12|3|Even though the previous reviews were upset due to the customer service, I actually had a decent experience. The workers that were there were young, so I had to take that in consideration. Two of the co workers were on break but talking to each other right by the line so you could hear it and they were also including the you g man that was making the sandwiches.  He was a true jokester so instead of getting upset I just allowed them to be kids. My sandwiches were made the way I wanted. The only thing that really disappointed me was I wanted to get a cookie but there were nats flying in the box they were sitting in and that disgusted me. When I made a comment, the young man chuckled and stated he didn't realize they were in there. So all in all I didn't have a bad experience."
"13|2|Like a previous review stated, the employees here act as though you are bothering them when you come in. Other than that, it's a typical Subway. Nothing special about it."
"14|1|Live in the area, never had issues. The employees were nice and respectful. It is exactly the type of service you expect. Place is also cleaner then most."
"15|2|M. padinI got in line and my husband behind me. Tiffany asked my husband 1st although he was behind me, what he wanted.  When she put the proteins in his sandwich and placed it to heat she turned to me. No hello can I he'll you. NOTHING- JUST A DEAD LOOK. I placed my order and she was very very cheap with the tuna salad. But then she went on to put the toppings on our sandwiches.  But instead of ringing us up, she left our stuff there at the register to ""help""other people that had just walked in and had no idea yet what to order!!!. 6 people later we were still waiting to pay and there were 8 people jammed into the aisle! A young man who had been helping to make the sandwiches then came over to ring us up. He was nice but tiffany should NEVER BE IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY!!!!"
"16|2|Sure they were busy.  Sure these ""artists"" have to work at Subway.  BUT FOR THE LOVE.  Worst customer service ever.  The ""artist"" kept putting stuff on my sandwich that i did not approve of.  Then I kept having to say ""more"" only to have the ""artist"" purposefully put a tiny on -- making me say ""more"" again!  she gave me the most hateful look.  Then at check out -- the cashier ""artist"" mumbled so bad i have no what i paid for or agreed to.  Unbelievable.  Located in a strip mall, with really squeezed parking.  Have fun!"
"17|3|This subway is usually cheap on the amount of meat they put in the sub and it's usually a really long wait. It's a pretty average subway, the one in the White Marsh area is way better. The workers here are also usually very miserable and don't look like they want to be bothered."
"18|1|Always pretty good food and service, but goddamn, do we gotta have church every fucking day at the sandwich shop? Put that radio on rock 108 for some devil music for a change."
"19|2|After a late evening work out, I decided to go my nearest subway near my University. Soon as I entered the building  I politely greeted the employee, but she didn't respond to me at all. So she continued prepping her bread on the pan. The employee then slowly turned around I said rudely, ""what can I get you"". The impression I got from her was not good at all. I said ""never mind"" and I left the store. She clearly didn't want to serve me, plus I did not feel welcome there."
20|3|My daughter wanted Subway before leaving for her first long trip on her own so i went.  As i walked in the person who looked like the manager scowled and walked away.  My daughter said it had a lot of ranch on it and fell apart as she ate it.
21|2|I went to this subway and we went to order and the service is SLOW it was terrible and the guy in there was pretty much making fun of the two teams I like the cowboys and the Spurs which those are two good teams the Cowboys may have had a rough start but I mean come on man that's cold especially if ur trying to order a couple of salads from the guy and it looked like the new girl had no teaming at all so if u don't Ming traveling 5 minutes to get to the next closest subway then do it unless u want to be there
22|2|I give 0 stars on this place. We went in tonight and ordered a salad for our daughter and she  found two hairs just as a bug was crawling out of it! We had a to go order. We promptly called to alert the manager of the situation who then instructed us to catch the bug and put it back in the salad and bring it back to the restaurant. We declined this offer & will not return to this subway.
"23|1|Went to the Subway on 14th Street on a Friday, got the basic ham and cheese with tea like I almost always do... Good service and good quality service. However I did notice while waiting that there's a problem that needs to be looked into. ITS TOO SMALL. The lunch crowd started to build there was not enough room. Maybe replace some of the booths with a counter and stools at this location would help.. Just an idea...."
"24|3|Today after running around town helping people, I decided it was time for quick sandwich, and no place is quicker than a Subway.  Rolled up on the Subway on South 1st. Not too busy for a lunch hour, got my ham and cheese on Italian quickly. Very pleased with it. The only problem or something they could change is the table right in front of the counter, Why have it there enough seats in the place just move them around a little."
"25|2|I came in to subway the other day and ordered a chicken bacon ranch and two kids meal turkey and ham and was charged for two full size sandwiches, and no toy. The worker wasn't wearing a mask and a little bit of an attitude after i asked her about the toys for the kids meals, and when i asked for her name. It took her about 30 minutes to make all three of my sandwiches. Subway never lets me down so i am very disappointed."
26|2|This subway is one of the worst and slowest subways ever. You would think a salad would be easy to make :/ I think I'm finally done coming here. If the salad was actually worth the price then I wouldn't mind the wait but for real?
27|2|Why is the guy at the register not doing anything and making the sandwich maker do everything including the veggies? The guy at the register barely even talks. Doesn't seem fair to the other guy and the cashier acts as if he's on acid or something
"28|3|I just had a 6 inch ham & cheese double meat with pepper jack, from the Subway at 1050 S Treadaway Blvd Abilene, TX 79602. Was pretty good, not a long line and plenty of places to sit, may have to go there again some time. Still more Subways in town I need to hit up."
"29|2|When I'm trying to find a random place for my very pregnant wife to use the restroom I try to find a stop that will let me grab a snack, a drink, a break, etc. That, in 35 words, is exactly why I stopped at this particular Subway while driving through Abilene recently. I was not really hungry nor thirsty, but I wanted to give them a little business for helping my copilot that happened to be roughly 95 weeks preggers. So while she went to where I only imagine is a magical place with couches and a masseuse I went to the counter. I stood in front of the register with nobody on the other side of the counter... there were no signs of life in the restaurant... it was 11:35am on a Tuesday and I was the only person in the dining and food prep area. When my wife walked up to me I was lost in a day dream about how I could go back and make any sandwich that was four feet long and two feet high, I was just putting the finishing touches on my ImagineWhich when somebody walked through the back room of the restaurant. I think he was building his own sandwich in his head because he did not notice me. I'm a small guy (6'4"" , 245#) so I wasn't surprised that he did not see me.By this time I was crazy thirsty so I was determined to get a drink, which meant continuing to stand there. After six minutes a person finally came up to the counter. He took my drink order and offered a cookie since I had been standing there so long. This experience was begging for a single star review but free cookies go a long way..."

"32|1|I like Subway cause its quick, easy, and cheap. Sandwich made the way you want it and plenty to fill me up. Good service and always busy. Tried the breakfast once. Not bad."
"33|3|Good food and nice people. But every time I go in there, only 1 person is working. And there are usually a couple of people ahead of me and it takes way too long."
"34|3|Stopped in Subway for a ham & cheese on Italian, at the Subway over on 1st street just down from Leggett. My friest time in this one, It was just like any Subway anywhere in town. I liked it"
"35|1|After 16 check ins here, and being the Duke, I figured I could at least drop a quick review to support my local sandwhich joint. They only have 2 stars which on not very representative of my experience here. I go here almost every day for lunch, I try to avoid 12-1 because they will get a line or that one customer who has 5 sub orders for everyone in the office.. (Eye Roll)The shop is in a weird spot - the side of a building around the corner of a shopping center, it doesn't bother me, but it's not very visually appealing and may deter some potential customers.Anyway it's a subway so the food is consistent with the rest of the chain. The staff is always happy and seam to genuinely get along as a team.I like to order the salad and they take the time to make it correctly and it's way better then the subs. Go at off hours when there is no line and they hook it up, extra chopping etc to make it really well done!The play Christian rock over the radio, not my favorite but it doesn't bother me. It may be off putting to some so figured I'd mention it.Anyway - go get a decent salad!"
"36|2|This Subway never has spinach so right there I have to take away a star. We ate here once or twice last year while staying in Abilene and I remember it being less than good. I don't know why I thought that would have changed, and last night my boyfriend went there to bring food back to our hotel room. He mentioned that the female manager was in a bad mood complaining about how someone failed to show up for a shift, therefor she had to cover and in doing so was, ""missing the new Dancing With the Stars episode!"" Such a travesty. As I unwrapped my sub I noticed how flat and sad the bread looked. I picked it up and realized that in fact it was thin and limp, not fluffy and chewy. Almost as if someone didn't cook it long enough. Also the tomatoes were mushy and tasted old. I ate half just because I didn't want it to go to waste. But from now on we will go to a different location."
37|1|Always fast and friendly at lunch!!! I love the chicken salad sub... wish they would keep it year round. Traffic getting in out if parking lot sucks... they should connect the parking lots so you can pull through to Catclaw without risking your life to try and turn back south.
"38|3|Came here to pick my hubby up some lunch it was pretty busy in there with all the Airmen on lunch, the place was cleaned and the stocked ( veggies etc). The employees moved fast and efficiently and still maintain patience didn't show any signs of stress over the rush which is always good don't like to feel rushed or that feeling as though I'm bothering them. For the review before they did have spinach but seemed to be going through it fast with the 4 people in front and 2 behind me requesting it on they're sandwich and salad as such. As far as the wait wasn't long at all 3minutes total from walking in to my car for those who want to come here for lunch and don't have a lot of time."
