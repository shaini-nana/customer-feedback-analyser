"The location of this Hilton is awesome. If you enjoy running outdoors, they are just a few blocks from a walking and biking path that runs along the Hudson River and is a beautiful/safe place to exercise. I love that this is an alternative if the onsite gym is full. They are also within a quick walk to a ton of great restaurants in Tribeca, China Town, and Soho, as well as  a bunch of subway stops to take you further away. My room was clean and spacious, and the bathroom was also a nice size. The only thing I would say with this hotel is that the breakfast is less than great. It left a lot to be imagined, but it did cover the basics (oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, eggs, bacon, potatoes, bread)."
"I am sitting in the lobby after staying here last night, waiting for my partner to get the car.We decided to stay in NYC since we were meeting someone to celebrate their birthday.  We just needed a nice hotel to share a dinner (take-out), dessert and a celebratory drink.  Really the only thing we need other than that is a nice place to sleep and shower.The hotel is nice.  The room was nice - and more spacious than expected in NYC.   There was a mini fridge and microwave. Unfortunately, that's where the ""nice"" ends.We were warned when we checked in that due to the low occupancy rate, it takes ""a while"" for the water to get hot.After letting the sink water run for about 5 minutes, it was still only luke warm.  When I called guest services, she told me it had to run 10-15 minutes for hot water.  I told her it was running a while and it was barely luke warm.  We tried again but then just got frustrated and turned it off.We pretty much gave up last night trying to wash our hands with anything even close to hot water.  Hey - there's a damn pandemic going on.  Soap and hot water would have been nice.So this morning we turned the shower on about 1/2 hour before was wanted to shower and leave.Luke warm. I called and they offered to send a person up to see why we had no hot water.  Too late.  We were getting ready to leave.  They knew yesterday it was only luke warm.  We could not even shower before we left.  I cannot even begin to imagine how much water is being wasted in this hotel.  It's disgusting.  I wonder if corporate knows about this.We expect more from the Hilton name.(Now we know why we had to ask for a bar of soap for the shower last night.  They only gave us one for the sink.  No one can shower with luke warm water...lol)Also want to note that the heating unit is EXTREMELY LOUD.  I am not exaggerating.   Sleep was not easy.  The street noise of Manhattan would have been quieter than the heating unit!"
We stayed here 8/15/19 to 8/19/19 Hotel is very clean. Rooms are typical for a lower priced City property which means small. The staff was always very friendly and helped with any requests. This hotel literally sits on top of the subway A C E trains. You can get anywhere in the city from here quickly. It only takes a few trips to figure things out. We started by using Uber and never waited more than 2 minutes for a car. The restaurant attached to hotel has a great happy hour and I highly recommend the shrimp app. Loved the sauce. I would definitely stay here again on our next trip to NYC.
"If you are looking for spacious rooms in a central location, choose this Hilton Garden Inn located right next to Canal Street.  This hotel is literally 10-15 minutes to everywhere in Manhattan.  I absolutely loved my stay from the moment I checked in to the time I left and checked-out. The hotel rooms are huge for New York City standards and have all of the amenities you would expect, including mini fridges which I found hard to find in NYC hotel rooms. There windows are large and allow you to get the perfect amount of sunshine in before or after a long day.  The beds are super comfortable.  The bathrooms are efficient and have bath tubs for those looking to soak away some of their stress.  More importantly, the hotel is near some of the most fabulous restaurants in NYC. If you are a runner like me, then you will be very pleased because there are lots of places to run near by.  I was able to run along the water and all the way to Wall Street.  Overall, this hotel is excellent, clean, spacious, and has friendly staff who want to ensure your stay is awesome.  They even send you texts to see if you want recommendations for anything!  I loved that touch."
"Nice enough property located in the heart of SoHo. That being said it's within walking distance to everything you'll love about Tribeca. Parks, museums, boutiques, high-end shops, vintage stores, restaurants, markets, bakeries, pizza joints, bars, bodegas, coffee cafes, you name it!There's a restaurant located on the first floor of the hotel, gym in the lower level along with business center for your printing, computer, working needs and refreshing water at the entrance. Rooms were decent. Equipped with coffee, frig and toiletries. Requesting fresh towels & a working iron took a while and there was a gigantic roach on the first floor as I waited for the elevator. I immediately advised the front desk gentleman who apologized. I was however grossed out. Completed my stay but won't be my first choice on rebooking in the future. ~Christy"
"Booked the penthouse suite because I wanted extra space so that my friends could drop by and visit. Check-in was fast and friendly. Arlene at front desk was helpful. I requested a couple folding chairs for the room and the staff was more than accommodating. We enjoyed our stay. As long as you are familiar with the HGI brand then you are fine. Last but not least, street parking was not an issue on Saturday night & all day Sunday. Subway across the street and location is near Holland Tunnel. Comfortable & quiet stay."
"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  No frills, clean, and convenient location.*Great location easy to get around from.*Easy access to subway*Water pressure is good and the water will get really HOT quick.*Decent size spartan room by NY standards.*Price point - you get for what you paid for.*Slow elevator - be patient.*Friendly & attentive service.*Great service from Teddy Bear and entire staff."
"Like any other hotel in NY City, this place is not cheap.  It is a bit far (relatively) from actions.  There are some eateries around but it is a good walk away from the Greenwich Village and Chinatown.  The good thing is it's close proximity to E train (subway).  The room and bed are okay and I've no problem with it thus far. I like the eKey and digital check in ( so I don't need to go to the front desk).  It is a hotel room for a good rest after a 14 hour day but nothing really that special."
"This hotel is a whole lot better than the reviews would lead you to believe.  I have passed this Hilton Garden Inn dozens of times, in years gone by, without giving it a second look. It is located in my preferred area of New York. Since 1990, I only stay downtown; Soho, Tribeca, Battery Park, The Village, Nolita, The East Village, and the Lower East Side are the only options.  You won't see me midtown. Ain't going to happen. In the past I have stayed at the Soho Grand, the Tribeca Grand (The Roxy) The Smyth, The James, The Thompson, Hampton Inn on Watts, The Trump Soho, Duane Street Hotel, The Conrad, etc. Yes, I have stayed at a lot of hotels through the years. Hotel prices and hotel taxes in New York have gone up exponentially.  The pricing can be ridiculous. The Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca is in a fantastic and safe location, walking distance to the Village, Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown, the East Village etc. The day time personnel are great, but beware of the weekly, night time staff. They can be surly.  Rooms are small, but clean with good water pressure, excellent AC, and our room was quiet. Bathrooms are also tiny, but everything works.  When the Tribeca Hilton Garden Inn is $60 or more per night cheaper than the other hotels in the area, that is irresistible. Just think what that can buy, or the great meals you can have with the money saved. This will be my #1 go to hotel on future trips to New York. Hopefully, I'll save a ton of dough."
"I usually stay further uptown when visiting Manhattan but decided to give TriBeCa a try. While I love the area, this hotel didn't measure up. Firstly, when I opened the door to my room, the stale air almost made me turn around and leave. It smelled like fresh hadn't reached this room in quite a while. Since I got in after midnight, finding another hotel was not an option so I decided to just make the best of it. I first checked the bed. The box spring had no cover on it and was a yellowed version of what used to be white. The mattress had only a thin cotton sheet which was very wrinkled. I slept on top of the covers with my clothing still on and left the next day. In the bathroom, the tissue box seemed to have old tissues stuffed back inside of it. There are so many nicer boutique hotels close by. Do yourself a favor and stay in one of them."
"Manager Mark has little regard for anyone with a heath condition.  I called several times to speak with a manager and Mark does not answer his phone.  Upon request of early check in over 24 hours in advance and the same day...I was met with no sensitivity to my epilepsy.  Just tough luck and I was asked if they could ""hold my medication?""   Really.  Could you hold my medication for me?   No, you can treat me like a Hilton rewards member and help me.   Never staying here again.   And come on Hilton.  This staff is super arrogant and rude."
"What can I say about the Hilton Garden Inn TriBeCa? That it is an outstanding hotel establishment with kind staff, unbelievably comfortable beds, great views, and much more. Some friends and I were out for one of our girlfriends birthdays, we are from NJ and had not initially planned on spending the night. As our evening progressed it was clear we did not want to go through the headache of catching the train back home. I immediately went online and found a reasonably priced room at the Hilton Garden Inn TriBeCa. I said to the ladies ""we have to book this!"" and we did! I called the hotel to ensure we would be able to have a late check-in as we were out on the town and it didn't seem as though the fun would be winding down anytime soon (City that never sleeps am I right???!) and they were very accommodating and allowed a very late check-in! Upon our arrival I was beaming because of how great the location was! Right down the road from the Freedom Tower!!! The front desk attendant assisted us with our check-in and sent us right up to a corner room on the sixth floor (top floor) which housed two of the most COMFORTABLE and PLUSH double beds I have ever laid on. At this point we had no complaints other than the lack of robes, and yes, this was a very minor complaint. When we awoke the next morning I couldn't believe the view! An absolutely stunning little area. It was truly a great stay. We were able to then enjoy an ice brunch in the area after sleeping in a bit. So if you are asking me ""should I spend an evening at the Hilton Garden Inn TriBeCa?"" My answer will me 11/10 YES!! It was a phenomenal experience especially given how last minute the booking was.To conclude, will I be returning for another stay? I'm sure you can already infer that answer, but I'm going to tell you anyway...ABSOLUTELY!"
"Very basic hotel. It could really use some updates with fraying carpet at thresholds and scratchy (low quality) sheets. The coffeemaker/Keurig was also really dirty, so run water through it a few times before using it. The night manager, Larissa, always greeted me with a smile when I came into the hotel. I literally upped my rating of the hotel by one star due to her warmth and overall awesomeness. Location is great, especially if you need to use the Holland Tunnel at all. Plenty of places to walk to (try the bodega across the street for a delicious and inexpensive breakfast sandwich), just be careful of the homeless encampment a couple blocks north of the hotel. Fitness center (in the basement) was small, but modern. Sports bar inside the hotel was jamming the night of one of the basketball playoff games."
"When picking hotels, I usually just look for clean rooms at a reasonable price. When the front desk staff is friendly and helpful, that's a bonus. The Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca was a bonus. Every staff member I interacted with, including several maintenance men in the elevator, was warm and friendly. That's not typical for a non luxury hotel in New York City. The hotel was happy to hold our bags, both when we arrived early and after we checked out. One employee offered (without our asking) recommendations for brunch as we were checking out. It wasn't a disingenuous plug for their onsite restaurant, but to another place in the neighborhood; he was just being nice. That's rare and impressive these days. Also, as a bonus, the location is wonderful when staying downtown. It's very easy to get to if entering the city down the West Side, or from New Jersey via the Holland Tunnel. And there is an entrance to the subway (A C E lines) right in front. Be aware: the signage is not that obvious. There is a blue sign somewhat flush with the building's facade, but we walked right by the front door when we first arrived."
We came here on a business trip. Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca staff are incredible! We needed an early check in... i called as soon as the plane landed and they set it up for us. We were and will forever be grateful as we needed it for reasons unsaid! The room was very clean and quiet! The location is awesome and there is a subway station right outside the main entrance! The staff are all very welcoming and intentional! We will be back!
"During our 3rd stay here last weekend, we experienced two security issues. We locked the room and left for 4.5 hours. When we returned, our door was ajar and held open by the deadbolt latch. It had not been serviced by housekeeping. When we immediately called the front desk, they had no explanation. Housekeeping said they had not entered our room, and the doorlock data showed inaccurate data that was not useful. We think it's important for our hotel rooms to stay locked when we are gone. Secondly, when we retrieved our bag from the lobby valet, it had someone else's bag attached to the handle. If we had not been honest and returned it, we easily could have left with an extra bag that was not ours. There was no verification of our name, number of bags or claim number by the valet attendant.  We can handle the slow elevators, noisy halls and bad pillows (as evidenced by previous stays), but these two security incidents will prevent us from returning."
"Best service, location and rooms. I had a great experience with the staff, especially Jasmine. She checked us in, got us a early check in on the quiet side of the hotel and kept checking on us our entire stay. Her smile and positive attitude was seen in every staff member. Great place, ran by even better people. I will be returning!"
"My friends and I stayed here for a few nights and in terms of location, this place is great. Literally steps away from the ACE stop with easy access to pretty much everywhere.The room itself was decent. I've learned not to expect too much from hotel rooms in NYC. The room seemed pretty clean, but I noticed that the sheet on our bed was ripped. Also, the side of our tub was broken (might have just been cosmetic...we didn't actually try to use it). The second day, the housekeeper popped in and asked when we wanted service, we asked her to return in about an hour. When we got back six hours later, it was very obvious that our room wasn't serviced.The staff, for the most part, was great. Nice, efficient, and helpful. Now, you might be thinking, ""Then why just one star and not three or four?"" Here's why. The valet attendant. Yeah, you read that correctly. The valet attendant is honestly the reason I am not giving this property 3 or 4 stars. Let me explain: I needed to head to JFK. Simple, right? One of the employees at the desk asked the valet attendant to help me hail a cab. He stepped outside and said he could order me a cab, but it would take 15 mins. He told me that cabs tend of avoid their street after a certain hour because it becomes a bus route (or something like that). I should have known from the start that there was something funny going on considering the large volume of cabs driving by. He said he would go inside to grab his phone ""just in case"" ...within the five minutes he was inside, I saw a bunch of cabs drive by. When he returned, he said he ordered me a taxi and it would be here in 15 mins. Okay...? I didn't ask you to do that, but whatever.Next thing I know, he said my car was outside and that the woman was just going to grab some coffee. When I walked outside, there was a jeep-looking car waiting. Totally unmarked, no service name on the side...nothing. Um...?So, I asked the valet attendant how much it would be since this obviously wasn't a taxi. He quoted me something like $62 or $66. Whatever it was, it was not the standard $52 flat rate that taxis charge. Looking through the trunk, I could see the car's interior and noticed there was no meter or license number anywhere in the car. So I said, ""This car doesn't have a meter or anything. I don't have cash so I have to pay on a card..."" He said, ""Oh, just a card? Well, see, a card is an extra $6 charge."" You have to be kidding me. I told him that was ridiculous. He took out cash from his pocket and said he'd cover the credit card charge. Whoa, sketchy much? I have no interest in getting into an unmarked car and paying more than what the flat rate should be.I was FURIOUS. He asked, ""So, what do you want to do?"" I told him that he was extremely misleading and that I wished he would have told me from the start that he didn't order me me a taxi, but that he was going to order me a private car or whatever.I told him that I was going to walk over to the next street and hail my own cab, which I did. The final price (with a generous tip) for my taxi ride was cheaper than what I would have paid had I accepted the ""private car."""
"I am shocked at the ratings given to this Hotel by Yelp users!  It really is a dump!  I stayed there, unfortunately, 6/18-20 for a conference. As a matter of fact, there were three of us who had the misfortune of staying there and we were all equally disappointed and dismayed. I am a Hilton Gold and always enjoy my stays at Hilton Properties even the modest ones, but this was really bad. The first room they gave me was 211 across from the elevator-tiny cramped, but the worst was the dirty bed spread. I wouldn't even sit down, called the front desk who apologized and sent me to 507. This was a large room by NYC standards, double beds, but the bathroom had one of those ancient jacuzzi tubs that was moldy, some of the towels were old, frayed and stained,!the coffee machine didn't work, the bed spread was pilling all over (old) and the mattress kept moving  so I had to adjust-I don't move a lot in my sleep so that didn't make any sense. Also, it was hot in nyc and the air conditioning worked ok at 67, but if you wanted to raise it to 70, it got really hot. Overall I am generous with two stars and that is because the front desk and maintenance guys were really nice. I will never stay there again, ever."
"The Garden Inn brand of the Hilton chain is usually pretty good. This one is about average.  The room was nice and comfortable, complete with a Keurig.  The hotel was clean, albeit a bit aged.  Plus, keep in mind that it's New York-sized, so there's not a lot of space. There is hot breakfast in the onsite restaurant that you can get as part of your room. On the Sunday I was there, it was chaos in the eatery.  The host or hostess that was supposed to seat us were busy doing bussing tables, so we seated ourselves. We had to find our own silverware and coffee cups. They might've been understaffed that day because everything was much smoother on Monday.  The food selection was good and included eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes, mini pastries, yogurt, fruit and a few other items. My primary complaint was where my room was. It was facing the alley across from the gym.  There were big trucks going in and out all night long.  Around 2 AM it sounded like someone was crushing glass bottles outside, so I didn't get much sleep. It was especially rough on the night before my 7 AM flight."
"Great price for a clean and nice place in NYC, issue with valet because of price discrepancy between what my reservation said and my actual price.  Manager said it was fixed but I still got charged and I called and they said called back.  Not really happy about that :("
So before I moved to bk I used to come to NY alot and I ended up staying at a number of hotels over a year. This is a hotel that I stayed in more than once and each time it was something that made the experience not 5 stars. I was in a room once that had a view of the brick building next door for example. I just thought is was customary to make up for it in service or room size or something! Another time I was in a room and there were cigarette burns and holes on the bed and sheets. I'll say that the hotel itself is not bad and the people working there were very very nice though which is why I give them 3 stars
"Summary based on 1 stay (99th hotel review):--great location, adjacent to Canal St subway (A, C, E)--room somewhat small, but fine--good security, door closed like a safe--great front desk staff!  Got an early checkin after a red-eye.--better than average Continental breakfast buffet in adjoining uncrowded restaurant--decent cost--quiet room, including aircon/heat--6 floors, ok elevator speed, but stairs are an alternativeVery, very good for this area."
"Excellent location, staff, and amenities. I was just looking for a clean, safe place to sleep on a quick visit to NYC, and this hotel is that and more. The staff was always friendly and helpful when we saw and interacted with anyone. Even though our room was right across from the elevator, I barely heard anything while we were in the room. You can't get closer to the subway-the entrance to the A, C, and E is right outside the door. Free wifi is a huge plus and we got a pretty good price for our room as well. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the bed and pillows weren't the best. I slept great but it was a little firm for my tastes. Unless I specifically need to stay in another part of town next time I visit, this will be my go to place."
"When the cab driver claims there is no such place, I tend to worry a bit. However, I've had several very nice stays here. The staff has always been extremely professional, courteous, and friendly. After a few days, the front desk staff called me by name. The manager (?) checked on things in the lobby.They have free coffee in the morning. Breakfast next door in the AOA Bar & Grill was nothing too special but I did have a nice made to order omelet once.Our room was reasonably sized and comfortable.The subway stop is right outside and could not be closer.Free WiFi with good performance.Will stay again."
"Overall, this hotel was a good place to stay if you're looking for something in the Tribeca or SOHO areas.  The outside is covered in flowers.  The lobby is large and inviting.  The elevators are large although a bit slow. The room was moderate in size with a large bathroom and very nicely furnished.  It was extremely clean and well cared for.  Our only problem was with checkin.  I neglected to checkin to a room via the web in advance.  When we arrived, the desk clerk could not find my reservation.  He found another person with the same last name, but not mine.  Finally after a few anxious minutes, he was able to locate my reservation for 2 nights.  Great...  Then as he was issuing me my keycards, I asked about breakfast.  He indicated it was in the attached restaurant/bar and was $16.95 pp.  Hmmm, I had booked a room & breakfast package.  He couldn't find any record of that.  I pulled out my hardcopy (lesson to the wise - always bring a hardcopy) which indicated breakfast included.  He had to make a copy of my hardcopy, indicated he would do some further investigations, but issued us breakfast coupons.  I heard nothing more from the front desk so I presume that all was ok and he found the full reservation.  Breakfast was certainly not worth $16.95.  It was a moderate buffet spread set up on the restaurant bar.  It had the usual breakfast buffet faire: cereals, yogurt, fruit, juices, waffle machine, pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, assorted bread, and some pastries.  You won't starve but it certainly wasn't a $16.95 buffet.  On the second morning we noticed a sign that indicated that one could order omelets and other items but our wait staff never mentioned this to us.  They did ""mention"" that the breakfast coupon only covered the price of the meal but *NOT* the tip.  Yeah, its NYC...."
The hotel staff here is by far the best I've been around. Very genuine people always with a smile and a suggestion for where to go for dinner. SO HAPPY WE STAYED HERE!
"The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They allowed us to check in at 10:00 am and upgraded our room in spite of our reservation being Priceline. Great location , close to Soho and Chinatown and subway station right outside the front door . The room was very large and comfortable. Definitely recommend this hotel ."
I stayed here with my boyfriend for a long weekend. I loved the area surrounding the hotel. There were lots of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. We were close to Canal Street and Little Italy. We also walked to the Hudson River boardwalk. The hotel was clean and the staff were so friendly. The manager Stainley was very helpful and kind. There is a train station right outside of the hotel.
"DO NOT STAY HERE! After a long day of touring the city, we got ready to get until bed, after previously checking into the hotel. I don't even want to write what I found in our sheets. They had not been washed,  there was food all over the floor from the previous guest, the shower was disgusting! We reported it to the manager and he said they would have new sheets delivered, which they did. We were so appalled and honestly sick to our stomachs over what we'd seen in our needs, that we asked for a new room. He was gracious enough to move us and promised for sheets to be delivered within half an hour. They were busy and we didn't mind putting our own sheets on at this point. Three hours later, still no sheets. Our poor kids were up with us until about 2:30am, waiting for sheets,  where we finally had to go to sleep. They ended up Sleeping on top of our comforterwith another extra sheet of ours over them. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! WARNING!"
"The service is freaking amazing. No seriously...we requested a trundle bed at check-in, immediately hopped on the elevator, walked down the hallway to our room, and were greeted at our door by ladies with the bed.The front desk offers gigantic umbrellas to cover your head during New York City summer storms. These umbrellas are free of charge...and they work. They're big enough to provide shelter for two guests and come without stipulations other than you must return them.If your travel plans don't have you leaving the City until later, you can delay your checkout time no questions asked. After checking out, you can even have the conceriage guard your luggage...including any bagged pastries you may have picked up on your morning walk. Oh...and there is always complimentary coffee and hot tea...and fresh baked cookies debut at around 5:00 every afternoon leaving the lobby smelling sweetly like grandma's house.5 Stars just for the service. All the other stuff was fine - rooms were clean, bathrooms were well stocked (in addition to the usual toiletries, the hotel provided mouthwash), beds were plush. The only minor teeny tiny thing was that the drainage wasn't super in the shower...but I'm sure this would have been fixed with a phone call."
"If I could I would give 6 stars. I booked this hotel months out and got a fantastic price. However I kept worrying b4 I got here because of some of the shaky reviews. Well I need not have worried. From the second we walked in the door to the moment I left they were FANTASTIC!!  Special kudos to Joe at the front desk. All the front desk clerks were fantastic but Joe really took care of us. I am hh gold so we got free breakfast and it was good. Basic variety of food with excellent service all 3 morning we were there. The last day however proved why Hilton is my brand and why service is everything. One of my traveling party got food poisoning from something he got off the street. He called down to the desk after hours of ""having food poisoning"" was literally shaking... He asked for something to be brought up and the front desk person ran up a free Gatorade. Who does that?  Hilton people that's who. Also my person was so sick they had to book a later flight and joe at the desk was able to find a room for them to crash in to a much later than normal checkout. The bellman also hooked me up with a car svc to airport that costs less than a cab. Nothing beats great customer focused service when you're away from home and sick. Bravo to all the employees and mgmt of this hotel. Kudos!!"
"Ahhh, this hotel was an amazing place to stay at for my very first trip to NYC! My gal pals Alice and Samantha and I planned a trip here for the week beginning with Labor Day 2010. At the time, Samantha was working for the Hilton in San Francisco, so we got a pretty good deal here!Upon entering, you'll find that the staff is extremely friendly! I showed up much earlier than my friends and wanted to do a bit of sightseeing on my own, so they took my bags and asked if there was anything else they could assist me with. Nope, I'm good, thanks! :)Every afternoon as we'd leave for our adventures, they provided us with delicious warm-baked cookies, coffee and hot chocolate in the lobby. One of the days, when I guess I looked ""sad"" that they ran out of the chocolate chip ones, they actually ran back and baked some more and brought it out for me.I'd definitely want to come back here next time I'm in NYC. The location is great too! Very close to the metro station."
"This place has consistently great rates, which is astounding since it's in the heart of one of the grooviest neighborhoods in the city.  Walk to lower manhattan sites such as 9/11 museum, Liberty & Ellis island ferries, or stroll all the way up the Hudson starting just a block away.  Subway right across the street to get everywhere else.  Very nice rooms and cozy boutique feel with the reliability/price of a major chain.  Probably wise to select a room away from the elevator on 5th or 6th floor - nice view over to Canal street.   Very courteous staff, clearly well trained.  I'm a longtime New Yorker temporarily out of my apartment; when back in the city I'll steer my guests here. A really nice ol' restaurant nearby is Walker's."
"My tips for enjoying this lovely, new hotel in TriBeCa:(1) When coming from Laguardia, make sure your cab driver knows that this hotel is on York STREET, not York Avenue, otherwise you'll get a long trip through Harlem on the way to the very wrong street.  Better yet, tell him to take you to 6th and Canal, cuz that's where you're headed.(2) New hotel = new fancy, adjustable beds.  Keep in mind that it might be on the hardest setting when you flop down, exhausted from travels...and avoid the whiplash that is sure to ensue.(3) Ask for an upgrade.  If gotten, you'll get a fabulous suite-type room with a mini-fridge and microwave.  Stock said mini-fridge with some beer from the little store across the street.  You'll be thirsty after sight-seeing all day.  (Oh, and the king-sized bed didn't hurt either.)This hotel is lovely.  Brand-spankin' new (no rehabs here, kids, they tore down a factory and built this one from scratch) and it shows.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating, there is a fitness center and a business center, and free internet in the rooms (if you bring your laptop.)Great location, right on the edge of TriBeCa and SoHo, and a subway stop right out front (A, C and E right at your fingertips.)And tip (4) Book on priceline.  Seriously.  You will thank me.I would definitely stay here again."
"Booked 4 days prior.  Got great rates for one night.  The room is pretty small but expected for NYC.  It was clean, the bed was pretty comfy and the staff was super nice.  The hotel is right above the Canal St subway stop.  We walked everywhere conveniently.  We would stay here again when in New York."
"Hey If you are looking for a business meeting crush when in NYC. I highly reccomend.The staff was friendly, make you feel like home and very atentive to all my needs.I am thinking of having a one day getaway with the wife as well.Very good pricing and serviceI will be sure to reccomend at workthanks"
Nice location.  Pretty close to a bunch of bars/restos to hit up.Huge clean room that had a huge window with a huge comfortable bed.Bathroom was clean and had a huge mirror which is important since I like to pose after I shower.I kinda like this spot.
"Good location and literally on top of the C Line on the subway, so easy to get to Penn Station, 42nd Street, Columbus Circle, etc.  Comfortable.  Your basic variety Hilton Garden Inn, but we had a relaxing time.  Would stay here again."
"Not just the best Garden Inn, but one of the best Hilton portfolio hotels I have stayed in. Rooms are large and clean with a beautiful view of the streets of TriBeCa. Each room also has a mini fridge, mini dresser, and closet. A/C was working great and kept me cool during a hot sunny day. Staff is very friendly and lobby/hallways looks great. Fitness center is also in excellent shape. If you're looking to stay in this area, definitely recommend this place as it is right above the A, C and E lines and is not too expensive for a nice Manhattan hotel in a great location.Only downside is the elevators are slow, but there are only 6 floors so does not take too long."
"I loved this hotel in TriBeCa! It was in a great location with the A,C and E subway right below. So it is convenient to get anywhere and not far from Times Square. It is also near shopping and restaurants that aren't so crowded as it is in TS area. This is the first time I stayed out of the TS area and the rooms were super clean and spacious compared to other rooms I have previously stayed in. The staff was very nice and always greeted us when we returned to hotel. And to make things better, the rates are very reasonable for NYC! I'll stay here again the next time I'm in NY. Thank you HGI TriBeCa for being such a great place to stay and making my family and me feel so welcomed and also for getting us transportation to the airport."
"The best it gets in terms of service, staff, location and room quality / standards. I have been hotel'in here since August of '10 and must say, that I have received the same service every time I am there. They know me by my name now :)Don't forget: to try out fresh cookies between 7-9pm.. they are the best!"
"This hotel is clean and located in a very quite area in downtown Manhattan.  It's about 10 mins walking distance from major discounted shops in SoHo.  It's also next to China Town.  The place is so convenient as the subway entrance is about 20 ft from the front.  At first, I was scare to go down to the subway as the stairs was dark and dirty.  But after we walked down the stairs, there is the subway police station right on the side with several officer was on duty.  This gives us a piece of mind to use the subway even during the night time.  We had used taxi's to come back to the hotel couple times and two of the taxi drivers don't even know how to get to the front of the hotel.  I don't know exactly why they don't know or just because they too lazy to drive around the one-way street or trying to take a longer route."
"Thanks to Hotel Tonight, I got this place for $130.  Room was fine.  I requested two beds (kids) and they came thru.  This is a small place, but worked well for us."
"Clean rooms, comfy beds, great and helpful staff, subway outside door, WONDERFUL eats within walking distance, quiet inside room (no view) we like open windows, reasonable, good value...what more could you ask for? WILL stay again...as long as our son stays in college ;-)! oh, they were able to accommodate us with an early check in. We took the RED EYE and were at the front door at 8am. All worked out as we checked out at 5:30 am..they had a cab waiting for us! GREAT SERVICE!"
"Great hotel and really nice front desk.  The only thing that sucked was their bathroom in the lobby.  It was beyond CRAMPED and HUMID.  Luckily, I only had to use it because we flew in early and we were not able to get early check in. The location was probably my favorite.  Although, it's in Tribeca, it was in the middle of everything that the group wanted to check out."
"I went back for Passover, which was well over l4 months after my first visit in 2012 and I am happy to report I am even more pleased with this hotel.The atmosphere is absolutely fabulous;you have a wide range of various'types' of interesting but not snobby guests, many of whom I wish I couldhave gotten to know.  Alas, it IS a hotel-and I'm sure fraternizing....theroom with the physical fitness equipment is small: the days when i was aloneand could tune in to my favorite SPORTS talk shows, I got some great workouts.But it turns out other people like to work out as well (!) in the morning and thespace IS small-compact but not suitable tor really indulging in favorite televisonor rolling around on the floor.  This is not really a complaint-its an observation.There is an Italian restaurant adjacent which is popular in the evening, butyou don't hear the noise.  The breakfasts are plentiful and the dining area givesa good view of Tribeca folk rushing off to work.  Very interesting view.I am particularly fond of Mr. James Ruiz, who is a Manager-and seems to'get' me-in a way that many New Yorkers do not-ie. when i would emerge with one of my most unusual hats, he did not STARE at me as if I were some creature fromthe black lagoon.  There is also a baggage man  whose name i did not get, who wasa large male  always had a smile for me.  I think others have found him to besuperior as well.   The entire staff is certainlyup to snuff-when I made a mistake in my reservation, they were able to accommodateme without any fuss.I really think of this as my home away from home. Next time I hope to find outif you can use one of the swimming pools some of the other properties feature.The location is not only CENTRAL, but there is an actual SUBWAY where themain entrance is merely a few feet away from the hotel.  Who could askfor anything more (Direct connections to uptown, downtown AND JFK, forthose of us who like to use public transportation."
"Bed could have been more firm for me, but does well enough, better than most hotel beds for a person with a bad back. Room was clean. Yes, my room faced the street. But, I was fine and slept through mostly everything, even though I can be a light sleeper. Staff during the desk is very nice. Staff at night not quite as much. Maybe cuz they have to deal with intoxicated people. I would say go to Distilled nearby for a great brunch, instead of Square Diner, if you want to spend a little more. Subway stop is right there alongside hotel!!! So convenient to get uptown. Memorial is a one mile walk."
"Clean and quiet, but I have to say I prefer the tribeca grand across the street.  Of course this one is half the price, so it's fitting."
"My family of 3 stayed here for a week.  The hotel is very standard certainly nothing luxurious about it.  The room is new York small which was to be expected but there were some short comings for sure.  For about $400 a night I would hope for no peeling wallpaper and a bathtub that an adult could actually bathe in.  The location is good as gar as subway access but tribeca is freeeay central so not all that pedestrian fruendly.  That being said it was safe, clean and the valet, Edwin, who is also like a conceriege was super helpful and friendly.  Overall fine, but will stay somewhere else next time."
