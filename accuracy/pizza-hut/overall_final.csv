1,2,3,"Came in here only because I had a business call to take and needed some quiet space. Since the little one was with me, I went on ahead and ordered a kid's meal which consisted of a personal pan pizza and a drink. The cashier was nice. The place was clean. Ample seating downstairs and for the location being in Midtown it wasn't too crowded. Now I can imagine why lol.The pizza...well, I grew up eating Pizza Hut and was pretty disappointed. I thought it was pretty funny that I was longing for the 2 Bros dollar pizza in Chelsea. Eating this Pizza Hut pizza just made me hungrier. How is that even possible lol?!"
3,1,1,I haven't even tried the food yet but Quantel made my whole night so much better by her sheer kindness and passion for humanity. She is truly an incredible employee and she helped turn my whole night around when another older employee had told me to leave. Thank you Quantel
6,2,2,"The worst things about this KFC are the prices, and the rude sales associates/cashiers. You can pay $9 for a two piece grilled combo! This is without a drink. Add a drink, and it brings your total to about $11.25. For this price, you can just walk a couple steps over and eat at the Applebee's next door, where instead of taking a tray of food from a rude teenage cashier, you can at least have the rude teenager bring the food to you.The Pizza Hut isn't much better. The prices are outrageous, and the pizzas have either been sitting out for a long time, or poorly cooked, or both (I KNOW!). It's okay, because my red hot anger usually melts the cheese on top just fine.My friend and I jokingly refer to this KFC as 'The Dungeon', because the main seating area is located underground(no windows). We also call it The Dungeon because it's absolutely a disgusting place to have to sit and enjoy a meal. They recently renovated the area, but it still has a sour smell. Since there are no windows, there is no ventilation, and the smell of sour mop usually permeates the whole space.  It smells like a porn shop (sperm and ammonia)...not that I know what that smells like, it's just what I've heard.The seating is cramped and uncomfortable. You may literally be sitting right next to that loud group of Spanish tourists who just won't shut the (expletive) up!  Cayate por favor! But yes, the seats are too close together.Many of the tables are wobbly and many broken underneath. Overall not a great space to eat.Overall this is a place you go only if you are desperate and don't have time to walk somewhere else. It's really expensive, so you may have to choose between that movie and a two piece box meal. Bon Apetit!"
7,2,2,"My friends and I were recently talking about the worst pizza you can get in NY, and Pizza Hut came up. Since we are dumb, we decided to come here and give it a shot to see if it is truly the worst pizza in all the land. It is. The worst part? A plain pie costs about $18 for a size that is nearly half of what you can buy at a hole-in-the-wall place (for a whole lot cheaper, too). The crust has a faint taste of freezer burn, making me wonder how long these things were frozen before being heated up again. And this location is so dirty that I'm confident there are 100s of rat and cockroach residents in the basement.Awful. Just.... don't. I'm ashamed of myself."
8,2,2,"Wanted to try the Boneless (I ATE The Bones!!!) type chicken as I'm an Avid KFC, KGC & you name it, most of my life, but this was another ridiculously bad experience at THIS location!!!My GF hesitated to eat any of it because she couldn't even tell if the White Meat was really white meat (she doesn't like dark meat chicken) and I agreed.  We cut a piece in half and then dissected it because it still  had sections that looked exactly like the DARK meat chicken that I love.. I was thankful cuz ""there's more for me"" until I started eating...It's like they added twice the seasoning & salt to the mix.  Very peppery/spicy but that was ""bearable"" until I realized how salty it was, too.  I could not satiate my thirst, woke up in the middle of the night HUGELY parched and got up to drink a HUGE glass of water when I got up.The service is usually bad, but this occasion made it ALL BAD.  Not a worthwhile experience at all.Wish I could give it a ZERO!"
9,2,2,"This is definitely the worst Pizza Hut ever.  I am really surprised that the Pizza Hut  Corporation has not intervene with this location especially since it is in such a heavily tourism area.I went to this particular location twice.  Two years apart and neither time was I able to eat my meal   Don't get me wrong, I love love love Pizza Hut.The last time I went to this particular Pizza Hut, I just ordered a Diet coke  and an order of bread sticks.  The breadsticks were very hard that I could not even bite it.  The first breadsticks literally made a snapping sound when I. broke it.I tried to eat the breadsticks.  I dunked the bread stick into the sauce that they gave me.  I thought the sauce was nice and warm, maybe I can try to eat these.  Well  I couldn't    The breadsticks were really hard as rocks.I took my order up to the cashier.  I apologized for being a pest.  I explained what was wrong with my order.  The cashier was nice and took them.  She told me to wait a minute.  She gave me what I thought was a new order. I sat down with my warm breadsticks.  Pulled one out.  It was broken. It was the same breadsticks.  They were warm BUT they were harder then rocks.  I made a joke and took out a unbroken breadstick and was more or less playing the drums off the table So, I threw the breadsticks away and left.Also this location is not really that clean.  Again I don't understand how the corporate allows this to go on   I understand that this location may be a franchise (but I don't know), but this location is giving the Pizza Hut a bad name"
11,1,1,"Stopped by to redeem a birthday treat. Ordered the cinnamon sticks online, & headed over. Staff was nice, a short wait, & I was out the door. My only complaint was that the place could use a renovation. Was pleasantly surprized at how good the sticks were. There were 10 pieces per order. Light & fluffy, inside, crispy, outside, with cinnamon on top. The dipping sauce was addictive, & sweet. I'd actually be inclined to order this again."
10,2,2,This KFC has very poor sanitation. The garbage areas are filthy and unkept. They are overflowing and spilling with so much waste left by the customers here and the workers don't do anything about it.
12,2,3,Over 90 minutes for an order (45 minutes late) with an order delivered by doordash. Understandably it's not the restaurants fault but nobody would take responsibility after delivery charge and gratuity. Rethink your purchase and buy local.
13,2,2,The snow fell and stopped but they did not shovel all of it and it's cause walking traffic and possible falls by the heavy traffic in front of bus stop...
15,2,2,The absolute worst service ever I don't really know why I make the mistake and order from this place. One time my order came wrong and I had to wait 45 mins for them to come back and deliver my right order and this time I ordered online and put specially for delivery at 7:45pm and it's 8:30 AND I'm fasting and I canceled the order because it's not here yet. The girl who picked up was extremely rude. This deserved ZERO stars I'm ashamed to even give you guys one star. Never again!!!!
14,2,2,Ordered for pickup... still had to wait over 15 min!  Why? Very slow service...go buy pizza elsewhere!
16,1,1,Before I used to order dominoes but now I order pizza hut and it's worth it they're pizza is the best the cheese is delicious and I recommend renember god loves you
17,2,2,"It was the night before Christmas... we called this Pizza Hut location and a lady picked up and said ""Hi, this is Pizza Hut, we are closed right now. HOW CAN I HELP YOU?"" Lmao what?? If you're closed why would you ask a dumb question like that... and my high school cousin was flustered and didn't know how to respond because of the dumb question asked by the lady working, so my cousin asked when are you opened? Which was wrong on my cousin's part but the lady responded aggressively saying ""WE ARE CLOSED"" and continued to say ""how about I get your number and call you continuously throughout the night and bother you."" I don't know who she is but she was extremely rude and aggressive. So unnecessary. This happened at 8:30pm on December 24th, 2020. So whomever was working at that time needs an attitude check and get a different job that doesn't require working with people. No need to be rude and please think before you ask ""how can I help you"" if you're closed. Not going to order pizza from this location ever again."
18,2,2,Worst pizza possible. Rather get little Cesars pizza than this garbage. And so expensive. These people don't care about the pizza lol
19,2,2,Became very ill after consuming the pizza from here. Be warned. I'm can not pinpoint the exact ingredient that made me ill but everyone that ate it got the stomach bug.
20,2,2,"Burned my pizza! Service is very slow as well, workers have no idea what is going on. You'll get better service at dominos."
21,2,3,"Pizza is decent, pretty much what pizza hut pizza should taste like. Pizza hut has gotten cheaper over the years (competition Im guessing) Personal pan pizzas are now served in paper thin white boxes with little to no writing on then, not this particular restaurants fault of course just thought I would mention: p Dirty people walk in to only use the bathroomPlace is filthy.Bathroom is filthyThe outside is filthyGhetto Colombian manager 15 year old in charge....Employees standing aroundTo many employees for a Saturday afternoon it seems Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it served it's purpose, Went in, bought my pizza, ate it and walked out."
4,1,3,"Of course there are better places to get pizza in NYC -- duh! But since I grew up on Pizza Hut, I get a craving for it now and then. And as this spot is close to my job, I've no problem stopping by for a pie. Now, is this place ridiculously expensive? Of course it is. It's a stone's throw away from Times Square. Is the staff rude? Nope. Not all all. Is this place dirty? Given its location, I'd say no. Look, when I come here, I know what I'm getting into. And I ain't about to complain."
23,2,3,"Pizza has gotten pretty expensive these days.  My local corner pizza parlor just raised their prices to $2.50 a slice and $16.75 a pie.  I decided to try Pizza Hut today because there was a 50% off deal on any medium or large pie for signing up with their Hut Lover's promotion.  It wasn't very good....My family used to eat at Pizza Hut restaurants with formal dining rooms all the time.  I remember it being good and was looking forward to trying their pizza today.  I bought a Super Supreme for a mere $8 before tax when it's normally $16.  It was definitely a good promotion to give them a try again....The pizza looked good and the flavors from the initial bite were quite TASTY.  But then you realize that the crust has the consistency of wet raw dough as it sloshes in your mouth.  It shouldn't be surprising though because the crust isn't even crusty as it's just a floppy limp mess.  Learn from my mistakes and skip Pizza Hut as it's not worth it even at 50% off.  Having said that, I'm not giving the green light on Domino's or Papa John's either.  Chain delivery pizza is just disgusting.  But I must admit that the Sbarro chain pizza isn't bad.  They have a special right now which is 2 pies for $20.  If you're looking to score a deal, that would be your best bet.  I think you might be able to get 1 pie for $10 on Tuesdays.  Check it out as that's what I plan to do...."
24,3,3,"Definitely not a pleasant place to eat in because it's so shabby and worn down, on the outside and inside. Also sometimes a drunk guy inside almost falling asleep.Pizza is good enough for takeout occasionally, especially for deep dish and personal pan pizzas."
25,2,2,"This is the Pizza Hut to avoid.Staff are young and unprofessional!  Asked one of the girls if she could wipe off the table, came over with attitude and wiped off the table with a dirty rag. Really?Pizza Hut pizza is really horrible anyways, Idk why as a New Yorker I would even stop by Pizza Hut...maybe I really enjoy the stuffed crust business.Filthy spot.  Smells like dirty mop, bathrooms forget about it.  Amazingly the only person really working is an older hispanic lady who cleans!  I question the A grade that they received."
26,2,2,"I love Pizza Hut deep dish pizza, but delivery from this place just isn't worth it. I'm a couple blocks away and put in an order at 3:00 p.m. on a Wednesday, yet it took close to two hours to receive a lukewarm pie that had clearly been sitting around for a while and seemed ""overdone"" as if it had been reheated. My understanding is that PH has switched gears and started running take-out deals to encourage walk-ins, while delivery customers wind up getting the shorter end of the stick. There's also an inexcusable four-friggin-dollar ""delivery fee"" independent of tip. Given that I tip a minimum of four bucks (usually more if you're coming from far away or the weather is bad) something like a third of the order price for a pie is just additional fees. That's simply unjustifiable for an ""assembly line"" pizza. The first time I ordered, I gave the young woman a fiver for a tip because I know it's not her fault, but this time I begrudgingly handed her two bucks and then felt like a miser afterwards while I ate my crappy pizza. I'm done with this place."
27,1,1,"Regardless what other ppl were saying about this place, I found this place offers amazingly good pizza which I even couldn't get in the city, not to mention about the little price I'm paying for a personal pie for just less than 6 bucks with two tops! I love this place."
28,2,2,"The pizza was okay, not the best. Very greasy and soggy. I don't know who hired the employees they do not know anything about customer service. Every single employee there that day had a terrible attitude and extremely rude. They do not greet you to begin with and have an attitude when being asked a simple question. They clearly hate their job. The place is also very dirty with about only 4 tables that they do not clean. The bathroom ? It's not a Pizza Hut bathroom it is a public bathroom !"
30,2,2,Made me vomit!!!!! Sooooooo gross! Not good pizza not good service bad location!!!! Forget this place it's horrible!!!
29,2,3,"My experience with ordering online for delivery using the Pizza Hut website has not been satisfactory because no coupon code is ever accepted for any of my orders, no matter which coupon code used, except for the chocolate cookie $1 off coupon, that's the only coupon ever accepted.My experience from the Pizza Hut Rego Park restaurant before today's order has been satisfactory. My previous order for stuffed crust pizza with toppings, the pizzas tasted good or fine. Same with my experience when I have ordered from other Pizza Hut locations.My experience from the Pizza Hut Rego Park restaurant for today's order is very unsatisfactory. The 2 pizzas I ordered and received taste bad, the crust is soggy and slightly over-cooked, there's very little cheese, the pork sausage and pepperoni smell bad and taste gamy, as if the ingredients used are old, and the meats used are tainted or becoming rancid. The taste and smell is so bad it made me vomit. I'm never ordering from the Rego Park location again, and maybe won't be ordering from any Pizza Hut ever again. I recommend avoiding this location.I sent an email through the Pizza Hut website, pretty much saying the same things I put on this review, to let them know about my experience and dissatisfaction with today's order."
31,2,2,"As a big fan of Pizza hut it stinks that I have to write this review. This pizza hut might be the worst in the country!!!! First the inside of this restaurant.. and calling it a restaurant is quite a stretch. There is like 5 tables and they are filthy. I do not feel like it asking a lot to just wipe down a table once and a while. Second the delivery zone is miniscule. I live 2 miles from this place and they refuse to deliver, but the dominos next door does. Third the douches that answer the phone have no idea what customer service is. The conversation went like this: "" Can I have extra blue cheese with my wings"" and he responds "" nah"". I said ""I do not mind paying extra"" he responds I said no right , you want the damn pizza or not?"".  "" Uh I ordered wings dude"", he hangs up on me, but not before he makes some racist comments. Fourth the pizza is miserable. Its very simple the damn instructions of pizza making is right in front of you, however these geniuses find a way to destroy everything Pizza hut stands for. The pizza terrible, barely any sauce, there barely is any cheese. T he crust is dripping with some kind of ""pam -like spray"", it truly is disgusting. This place sucks!!! Please owners if you read this bring the citizens of forest hills a decent pizza hut... not even a good one, but this travesty will not do."
32,2,1,I had pizza from here years ago and it was not bad. However I live in Rego Park and they don't deliver to my neighborhood. What gives? The Dominos down the block from this Pizza Hut delivers to me. Hopefully I'll get an answer from someone at Pizza Hut.
33,2,2,Ick. Makes me sick.... literally.  Why get nasty franchise pizza when NYC has REAL pizza all over the place???
34,2,3,pizza did not taste great and the doe was not the original i was use to. i think its just rego that does make it the great.
35,3,3,"I have a love hate thing for this type of pizza. Sometimes you don't want real pizza and you want this type of whatever this might be. I'm not knocking it by any means but compared to a real slice of pizza this is just, well, Ehhh. Their wings are ok but over priced IMO. Service here is what you would expect from these chain pizza places."
36,2,3,"Ehhh I usually order for delivery, but for some reason it always takes them more than an hr to deliver a pizza and some wings and by the time it gets to me its already cold. I rather go to a supermarket and by a frozen pizza and throw it into my oven, i think it would cook faster by the time they get here. Atleast ill know my pizza won't be cold."
37,2,2,"worst store in the world ever!!!!bad service, even the worst manager in the world ever!don't order it because it's going to waste your time and money!!"
38,2,2,Absolutely horrible pizza. It took over an hour and a half to receive two medium pies and they tasted like cardboard. Ellios tastes better. I will never order from here again.
39,2,2,Tried pizza hut twice at this place and I must say this is the worst pizza  I have tasted.  ICK
40,3,1,"this pizza hut is actually a pizza hut express. it's a barebones restaurant, with 3 or 4 small round tables for customers to sit at. it's conveniently located at 63rd drive and queens blvd. i mean what can you say about pizza hut pizza? i like bringing it home to put into the freezer and reheating the slices at a later time to have. granted i can probably have better (this is new york we're talking about), but i still like it. the pizzas have gotten a bit more expensive lately, but i'll still go there every so often."
41,3,2,"Don't bother. Ordered an hour and half ago, called twice, and found out the driver tried to deliver to the ""wrong house"" but they didn't give me a call to ask where I was. They asked if I wanted them to send the pizza out again and I told them no thanks because it's been an hour and half in 98 degree weather so it's definitely no good.Update: Irvin the GM called me back immediately to rectify the situation and sent me a fresh order free of charge. I definitely appreciate the gesture but would've been nice if they got it right the first time."
42,2,2,Would give a zero star ....Elizabeth is the worst ...unprofessional and on personal calls ...didn't get my order on the apps ...when I show her the confirmation email ...she put a face to talk on her phone I would never go back there again
43,2,3,"Did they photoshop my pizza? My pizza just look like the online illustration. Props for making it artifically visual appealing. That was the only thing that i was impressed with. As usual, everybody who ate pizza hut knows this that it goes down hill from here.pizza hut was the only pizza shop near the area. Flushing needs new pizza shops. Any recommendations?I ordered the meatball/ spinach and sausage/pepper pizzas. I was disappointed by the sausage/pepper as the toppings werent as noticeable. meatball and spinach were decent and workable toppings in the future. Now to the cheese and sause, both were lacking any substance. Waiting for the day when a company can deliever high quality pizza."
44,2,2,"I was really disappointed with my experience here last night.My brother and I were picking up food for my family on the way home and we decided to get pizza. Since we were thinking about what to get on the way, we didn't order ahead. We parked in front of the Pizza Hut at 8:00 and placed our order. We hung out in the car for about half an hour since it was supposedly going to take about 20-30 minutes to prepare our order (two medium two-topping pizzas and one large two-topping pizza). Plus, we had prime parking there so we weren't going to leave that spot open!So we went into the restaurant at 8:30ish and we asked about our order. The girl we spoke to said that it wasn't ready and that it would be ready in ""five to seven minutes"" (that's exactly what she said). Fine. We sat down and waited... and waited... and waited. I guess we must have been immersed in our phones or something because it was 9:11 and so we went to the counter again and asked another lady who may have been the previous girl's boss or manager or something (she was explaining how to do something to the first girl for the customer before us). We were getting really hungry and annoyed so I told her we've been waiting almost an hour for our food. That's when she went to the delivery pouches and pulled out our pizzas and said ""They JUST came out."" That's all she said. Not an apology for the pizza taking so long or the fact that the pizzas were just sitting in the delivery pouch - it was one of those two things, and she didn't acknowledge it. All she said to us was ""They JUST came out.""I get that the place was probably busy with incoming orders on a Sunday night (quite possibly a lot of people getting food for watching football) but don't have one girl tell me that it will be ""five to seven minutes"" and then make us wait *40 MINUTES* for the order, and then have the nerve to say ""They JUST came out."" Totally unprofessional and it really made me not want to come back here, which is a shame since I love Pizza Hut and I usually like this location."
45,2,2,"Terrible takeout experience. Came here to take advantage of the $5 promotion but the staff was very dishonest. Ordered two one-topping pan pizzas, light on the sauce. Hardly any foot traffic but they took nearly 30 minutes to complete my order. One employee was too preoccupied with her phone to attend to any of the customers. When the pizzas were finally done I was quick to check that they got my order right. Guess what? No!Instead of pan pizza they gave me hand-tossed. I'm not a fan of hand tossed. When I told the person at the counter she responded that the promotion only was for hand tossed. How come you didn't mention that when I placed my order?A few days later, out of curiosity, I checked out the Pizza Hut website. And behold, customer got to choose whether they wanted pan or hand tossed and the price was the same. I would have had no problem if the staff was simply upfront about their mistake. But I don't like being fed lies."
46,1,3,"Oops I checked into the wrong address because the other one showed up first. This location has only 3 tables and some people like to take over the space and not caring that they do. Even though my bus passed through here like a millionth times, I finally went in today and I spotted those adorable personal pan pizza. I ordered a Specialty ($5.99 + tax) of Meat Lover because I am a super carnivore. The crust is crunchy and the pizza is thick and each bite made me oh wow, oh wow ""mama love meat""!"
47,2,2,"My worst pizza experience in my life!!Stay away from their shitty hidden fees.I saw an ad where it said large pizza for $17.99 , but when I order 1 large pizza with 2 liter Pepsi I was charged $28.** 1)$1 extra hidden charge for ordering in menu2) $4 delivery charge that is outside of deliever tip3)tax4)they promise 45 minutes but took 1hour and 45 minutes to come (I ordered at 6pm, came at 7:45pm)5)deliver brought me 16oz bottle instead of 2 liter I order, also the recipe was changed from $28 something to $27 something. 6)delivery girl didnt even gave me the change,or even ask  she just kept it for her tip wtf was that?7)last but most importortantly the pizza was shit. Cheese was super extra thin while the bread was super thick. 1 to 7 ratio. Stay away.. I will never ever order again from pizza hut overall. Order at papa johns or just regular italian style pizzaria"
48,2,2,"Do not order from this place! They will charge you for all the extras and not add them! Then they tell you that you have to drive back to them and bring them the crust for a 9$ refund even though they charged you 13$ for the pie! By manager Sarah's admission it is Pizza Hut policy that if they screw up your order then the customer has to come in and basically pay for the mistake because she has no proof of the things that are being said! Well Sarah here is the proof of crust without the fiery red pepper crust and burnt jalapeños! This is 2015 and I do not need to drive 20 mins there and then back just because your rude self can't admit a mistake! I would give them a glowering middle finger if that was an option on Yelp! Yelpers unite to teach these crude and rude people a lesson, do not get your pie fix from these trolls!"
49,2,2,"Going on 2 hours waiting for my food. Delivery driver had a flat on the way to us, didn't notify the store to let us know the delivery will be late. Lets see how long it takes.Update:Cancelled my order and asked for a refund, can't get refunded until tomorrow and I have to call back for it. Never again. This isn't the first time this happened either and I still decided to order."
50,1,1,"Wow! Best way to describe my visit there. Came with my girlfriend to dine in and was met with exceptional service and care by one of their employees. I didn't catch her name but she was fantastic. Did everything from taking our order to make sure we had plates, napkins and utensils. Probably one of the best service ever received and we've been too many restaurants. They could all learn from this young lady. We even tipped her at the end after we finished our meal. Pizza and pasta were fresh and tasted so good! The pizza had the perfect combination of soft and crispy. Pasta was so delicious. My girlfriend loved it! Definitely be back to this location!"
51,2,2,I don't want to even give this place 1 star.My order was placed at 7:44 and  i received it at 9:15 when i ordered from the website it said i would receive it by 8:45. I know that online ordering is not always accurate but my entire order was cold and the pizza was hard.When i called to speak to the manger or the person in charge she was non apologetic and very rude i asked her to refund me my money or send a new order back to me she was very  nasty and was not trying to help me in any way.  she told me it was not her fault or problem that the pizza was cold and if she sent another order the same thing was going to happen. i am very upset and i will never order from pizza hut again.I can not believe such a notorious company has so bad employees what happened to the customer is always right.
52,2,3,"When I order from this pizza hut, I usually expect the usual long delivery times and a lukewarm pizza. This is fine, as i always tend to just reheat it up. I always let this issues slide because at least this location is consistent with this. However, this was the last straw. Pizza came to my house like it was dropped on the floor and shoved back into the box. See the pics."
53,2,2,"absolute garbage service.ordered 2 hrs ahead on nye for a delivery by 8:30pm.I never got the order.  Tried calling the store multiple times and just got a busy tone.  Now i understand that they were probably busy (it being nye and all) but a courtesy call saying that they wont be able to fulfill the order would've been nice.  My party and I starved that night.  Finally got a call from a gentleman at 11pm asking if I would like the order or to cancel.  I specifically told the gentleman politely that i would like to cancel the order.  2 days later and i see that i still got charged for the order.  I called the branch and an obnoxious lady picked up and tried to prove me wrong about my order.  i don't know why.... all she had to do was give me a refund.  She asked if i would like the order now... 2 days later... NO I DO NOT WANT THE ORDER NOW.  She put me on hold, came back and asked me to recall the exact order that i placed and the exact amount that i was charged.  once again... I don't know why she required me to give her all that information when she clearly said that she had my account on file and pulled up in front of her.  Once i gave her the useless information she was asking for,  she told me that i was incorrect and that that wasn't the order i place.  Does that even matter?  I got charged for a delivery that was never made! Just give me my refund.  once again she put me on hold and came back and said ""do you want store credit?"". NO... I WANT A REFUND...  There was absolutely no reason for her to give me such as hard time.  a mistake was clearly made from their end and all they had to do was apologize and give me a refund.  I never got an apology from any of the pizza hut employees i had to deal with.  Completely unprofessional.  I am disputing the charge with my credit card company directly.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.  I don't blame the gentleman that called me at 11pm that night.  He clearly seemed overwhelmed.  I must ask why they don't have a better system set up for busy days like NYE.either limit the orders or call the customer directly and let em know not to expect any food by the time they wanted it!  thank god i had enough liquor to drown my rage and ring in the new year with my party."
22,2,2,"My husband has been craving for pizza hut and today we decided to drop by and order to-go. We've been in the line for 5 minutes or so waiting for the employee of the At&t to be finished ordering his food (with discount since he works next door). Finally it's our turn to order when suddenly the pizza hut employee told us to go to the other cashier and there are 4 people waiting there. We decided to left instead of waiting for what, another 15 mins? He could've told us earlier that we need to go to the other cashier since he saw us waiting for him. He's even the manager of the store, SMH. They need to improve how they communicate with costumers."
55,2,2,"This has to be the worst pizza hut ever. Every single time we order , it takes close to two hours and the pizza is ice cold."
56,2,2,"I ordered my meal and was given an ETA of 7:30PM. After 10 follow up phone calls and 2 hours later, this place informed me that my order was cancelled. If I never called to follow up, they would've wasted more of my time and would have never informed me of my cancelled order. Worst customer service for mediocre pizza. Avoid this place and save your time."
57,2,3,"Food is typical average fast pizza hut quality, yet not super fast. Tables inside were all in need of a wiping down."
58,2,2,"Late delivery. Internet order show 7:59PM as the expected time, arrived 8:25 PM. all the food is coldAND Surprised to found the chicken wing we ordered is RED RARE or I should say. its a Fresh meat from freezer. my wife took a bite and almost threw up! I called a restaurant spoke to a female worker, she made it sounds like this is a common thing took me while to go through everything with her told her all the detail, she asked me to hold. a male manager answered. asked me whats s the problem  is, I told him I dont want to repeat myself, he said she told him I wanted to speak to a manager, which is a lie. then this ""manager"" said its not his problem all the food is cold delivery is late. and when I was telling him about the chicken being red, he said I'll give you money back you keep the food! yelled at me and hung up.no apology , no nothing. just a simple nasty attitude I got from him.. I just took all the pics of chicken. I will make sure people know about this.BE AWARE BEFORE ORDER FROM THIS HELL HOLE! or STAY AWAY!I already had many disappointed food from them but I kept ordered because my kids like cheese sticks. but NO MORE. THIS LOCATION IS WORSE!"
59,2,2,TRASH and after talking to the manager I know why. The food was super late and cold and after I get the call I can see the pizza boy running down the street with my soda in hand. After checking the food I requested my money back that's the last time i order from these bums LETS GO DOMINO'S there right next door came to the rescue in 38 min man I forgot how good that phillie cheese steak taste. F OFF PIZZA HUT You just lost a customer.
60,2,2,"Possibly thee worst customer service experience I've ever had, placed an order at 630 and still hadn't gotten a delivery and it was 830 .. called the store to see what was going on and was told to give them about ten mins waited another 30 mins and nothing .. at this point I am beyond disappointed and aggravated because it shouldn't take 3 hours for a delivery I called the store told them to cancel my order because my credit card had been charged already and they keep putting me on hold or hanging up it wasn't until the 3rd time I called that they cancelled the order and told me it take 5-7 business days for the money to be back on the account .. not only was I put on hold a bunch of times but I could hear employees talking bad while thinking I was on hold .. also when I asked to speak to a manager I was told there wasnt a manger on the clock and no one would give me their names .. I order from this Pizza Hut all the time but this is the last time I ever give this business any of my money"
61,1,1,I grew up on PizzaHut. Who doesn't think PH has great pizza?
62,1,3,"I ordered online for carryout since this pizza hut doesn't deliver to my part of town. I ordered a large pizza with three toppings, breadsticks, and a 2 liter of soda and it was the 15 dollars deal of the day. When I ordered online it said it will be ready in 15mins so by the time I drove out to ph it was ready. I was surprised how on time this pizza hut was with my order. They got my order right and the pizza was delicious of course. Oh and ph breadsticks with the sauce is just as amazing. This isn't the first time I ordered pizza from this pizza hut but so far it has been a good experience. If only they deliver to my part of town then it would be awesome."
63,2,2,This place has the worst customer service... you cant expect much from this location bc it's always busy but it doesn't make sense that 1 pie is here after an hr and 15 min... !!!!! The nerve of the delivery guy asking me to come out across the st too. It's a freaking 2 min car ride!
64,1,1,"Food tastes and services is really good. I got my food faster then I though. All employees are good, and nice. Love u all."
65,3,3,"let me just start by saying i secretly love pizza hut. it's one of these extended-family childhood traditions because when we all got together, grammama ONLY liked pizza hut and their pan crispy crust. so when the fams got together once a month, we all laid out in this dramatic long table and chowed down. so yes, my childhood memory-brain worships pizza hut.fast foward to adulthood. ordered some mediums and it was ALL dough, NO cheese, SCANTY toppings. absolutely pathetic :( the breadsticks were stale and i have to pay for my extra marinara (i eat the crust like breadsticks and dip, try it, you'll thank me).that said, delivery was superquick (weekday 3pm-ish order, was here, 5 min from location in less than 30 minutes). happy with service, but perhaps pizza hut in general is dulling its shiny red hat..... sad face :("
66,2,2,So I ordered a cheese pizza and not only did I wait an hour but when the pizza got here it was COLD! My girlfriend had a slice and she kept complaining so I decided to call. I was told thin and crispy pizza drys out easy like are u serious I've ordered pizza a thousand times and there's no reason the cheese on my pizza should be cold they are 5mins away from Me and I waited an HOUR !!!!! Do not order from this location !!!!!! I should have listened to the previous reviews!!! Ugh
67,2,2,They took 2 hours- I am never ordering delivery from them ever again! Worst Pizza Hut ever
68,2,2,An hour delivery and Horrible pizza! Tasted salty and the meat was definitely not fresh. I ended up tossing away all the topping because of how gross it tasted like! Will not order from here ever again. Now I just hate myself for not ordering from dominos.
69,2,2,Ordered online and time of arrival was 2:03. At 2:15 I called and the girl said the driver left 15 minutes ago..he should be there any minute. Pizza came 30 minutes late.. Burned at the top and soggy oily at the bottom.  If I wanted to cause drama I wouldn't have paid..and slammed the door in his face..  Horrible service..horrible pizza.
70,2,3,"Had a medium supreme pizza. Tasted really salty and similar to frozen microwave pizza. Actually frozen pizza could've tasted better. Im giving an extra star only because of fast delivery. Actually came in20mins, but i live 2 blocks away and most huts do not deliver."
72,2,2,"Pizza Hut is my favorite pizza, so it hurts to have to give this location 1 star. I've been here twice and both times there was nobody at the register. I had to wait for an employee to come out the kitchen. On my first visit I did receive a freshly cooked meat lovers personal pan pizza after the wait. On my second visit right after the employee announced he would be out in a minute I noticed another unexpected visitor was also waiting for pizza.  A big roach was slowly walking around on the counter, very comfortable, like he was waiting for his order. I had to get out of there after seeing that. I couldn't stomach waiting for my pizza with a roach. Eat here at your own risk!"
71,1,2,"Universal pizza hut taste!  I miss upstate.  I miss my family.  I hate school.  I hate this sales guy at the union sq Best Buy. I really need a laptop by Tues but I just cant buy one from a jerk.I wanna run away and become a flight attendant and make my friend Joann become one too.  Dance class was just ok today.  The moves were fly but the  class concentration was off.  I got really hungry afterwards tho.  Probly cuz it was a special twerkshop that served wine but most likely from my yelp directory search for a nonexistant Staples Office Supply store within Penn Station. Thanks for playing me Yelp editors.  Get it togetha.  Please.  My only solace was spotting this Pizza Hut Express amidst all the train travelers.  Aight yeah why not?  Im going in.  Yes i grew up on pizza hut.  Yes i like Detroit style pizza.  Yes i know they're really from Kansas.  The counter guy was retarded.  Yes.  Yet the personal pan, hawaiian style was fresh, comforting and filled my void of hunger and of other lonely parts within my body*.*not referring to the putang"
73,1,2,"Pizza Hut, more like Pizza Butt. I'm tired of their circle pizzas. Why do they all have to be circles? Give me a square pizza any day of the week over a dumb circle pizza. Wasn't impressed with all the cheese and sauce either. No cheese or sauce next time please."
74,3,3,"Decently good pizza at a decent price.  The cheese tasted cheap, but you get what you pay for."
75,3,3,"This place is nothing more than average.  The prices are very high, but considering it's in a food court in Penn Station in the middle of NYC, I guess that's to be expected.  Personal pan pizzas were around $6 each, and they are the size of a frozen microwavable pizza.  I'm not sure how this setup works, but when I ordered our pizzas, the cashier walked over to KFC, went into the kitchen area, and walked back out with two boxes containing hot, personal pan pizzas.  The cashier seemed somewhat distant, and when we asked him for forks (the pizza was very soggy and not cut all the way through), he seemed to get annoyed.  The pizzas had an obscene amount of grease.  The selection here was minimal, almost zero.  All they really offer here are personal pan pizzas and some sort of sticks."
76,2,2,"DON'T EAT HERE!!!!  Never again.  I don't typically write reviews, but this experience was so horrifying I figured I had to share.I had been here a couple of times before and was willing to over look the grungy and greasy exterior, and the fact that the food was only ever luke warm at best.  Since it is in the middle of Penn Station and the cashier was always offering to pop my food back in the oven for a few minutes to reheat it, I believe my low expectations were in line with what one should expect.Not this time.  I ordered bread sticks and a personal pan pizza.  To my dismay, the bread sticks were over cooked but enjoyable enough.  However, when I pulled apart the slices of my pizza, I found not one, but multiple strands of hair threaded in the middle of the pizza throughout the cheese in each slice of the pizza.  It was as if someone had combed their hair with their hand and then stuck their hand in the cheese before they sprinkled it over my pizza.This is totally and inexplicably unacceptable, and downright disgusting.  I love Pizza Hut's pizza, but I will never, ever eat here again."
77,3,3,The service was friendly. The pizza cheese quality was OK. However the onion in the pizza was cut in big pieces and that wasn't really cool :-( In general it was a good experience for somebody who is eating pizza from time to time.
78,3,1,Me & My Friends came here one at this Pizza Hut I had the Pepperoni pizza it was ok...
79,2,2,"Save your money and go somewhere else. I used to come here to get taco bell a long time ago and it was okay. Today I went to pick up a large pizza for my grandmother. I even called twice to confirm the order. But when I get there, I get a medium pizza with skimpy amounts of ingredients. I explained that this was the wrong order and that I had spoken to someone on the phone and was told that the person wasn't even there. Apparently they don't even take orders at this location So I was stuck with this ""medium"" pizza for $14.14 what a waste of money"
80,1,1,This place generally I don't know about.But pizza hut has the best and my most favorite pizza in the world it is completely amazing.You have to go here.
81,1,1,"I don't know bout everybody else but I never had a problem with them always deliver on time food still hot, always get the 10$ dinner box. Great"
82,2,2,"My food was left on the concrete floor, in a clear garbage bag, on the corner. Not even in front of my door. When I called to find out where my pizza was, I was told it was ""left on the porch"" I don't have a porch... My pizza is currently sweating"
83,2,2,"I have travelled 30 minutes to this location twice. If I go here again, it will be an accident. I have no problem paying extra for extra cheese, but if there was any extra cheese, it was negligible at best. I got stuffed crust also. They didn't put the butter flavor on the crust. Again, I don't mind paying extra, if at least I am getting what I'm paying for."
84,2,2,Worst pizza hut I've ever ordered from. Which is unfortunate because i love the hut and hate other places such as dominos or cici's pizza. I live exactly a block and a half away so theres no reason my breadsticks should come so hard they're basically long croutons at this point. Marinara sauce felt like it just came out of the fridge. The pizza itself was so cold it wasn't worth eating. I give places second chances and i did the same with this place. Same situation different days. I will never be ordering from them again. Don't waste your money there are plenty of local pizza shops willing to deliver pizza thats hot and ready to be eaten at a better price.
85,2,2,"Horrible. I ordered Pizza at 4pm time now is 6:26 pm and still haven't received the right pizza. I called and ask what's taking so long the manager stated the driver was in an accident sorry for the delay..... the driver gets here I asked him was he ok from the accident he said ""What Accident"" which mean the manager lied. Currently waiting for my pizz"
86,2,2,Terrible service. Placed an online order 40 mins prior to arriving for pick-up (even though It said it would be ready in 10-20 mins). Not only was our order not ready but they claimed to only have received half our order. The worker there was clueless and they're understaffed. Be sure to place an order an hour or so before you plan on picking up.
87,2,2,My pizza is cold. They forgot one of the pizzas that I paid for. They were extremely nonchalant and unapologetic about it. Bumbling idiots. Won't last long here with this type of service. I'm never wrong about these things.
88,2,2,"I placed a very small order midday and expected a bit of a wait but after an hour and a half my food still hadn't shown up.  I contacted the store only to be told the delivery guy should be coming in a few minutes since I only live 5 minutes away I figured I'd be getting the delivery shortly fast forward another half an hour I call back the store for another update to be told by Kevin (if that's even really his name) that the delivery guy came to my home and couldn't find it.  I live on a very accessible block and have never had any issue with food or package deliveries plus the driver never even tried to call. ""Kevin"" didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. Worst experience ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Update****I never got my food and it took 3 months to get my money back had to get my bank involved.DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!"
89,2,1,"It's not my first time here, but it's a big difference between Brooklyn and Long Iand. Okay they are more friendlier I. Long Island they are willing to help you with questions. This guy just nodded, dry eyes and dry face. And trust me I do reverse psychology by killing ppl with kindness. With people who just doesn't have good customer service it don't grace the situation. Pizza was good though, I wish they deliver because my friend lives right down the block. Anyway pls smile next time."
90,2,3,"This place is foul when it comes to delivery, my review and that one star is based strictly on my delivery experience. So it was Sunday around 3pm and I usually get dominos because of the wings but I decided to get Pizza Hut because my fiancé loves it. We order around 3:30 and and the two pies didn't come to us until 5pm they were cold!!! Breadsticks were trash never again."
91,3,2,"So to be honest I usally bypass reviewing fast food places or franchises......however with the horrible reviews for this particular Pizza Hut.....I wanted to chime in......So everyone thinks I am crazy.....I live in NYC however I am a southern gal......who grew up eating pizza hut.......and I LOVE Pizza Hut pizza...So I went in with my 6 year old daughter to grab two pizzas for a late lunch .....this particular shop is only take out....there is nowhere to dine in at...I asked the cashier for any available specials and she informed me that to take advantage of any specials I had to order online......I did not mind that at all.....luckily my phone was charged.....placing the order online was very easy.....and I was told my order would be ready in 20 min.....and to pay upon pick up......by ordering online it was a huge savings.......if I had order the same off regular menu....I would have paid $18 - $20 more.....while waiting the cashier made small talk with me and offered my kid stickers and coloring book......I told her about my passion with Pizza Hut and that it sucks that they do not deliver to where I live.....she told me about a awards program that I signed up for right away.....my order was ready in like 17mins.  While I waited for Uber to arrive they kept my pizzas in a warmer....The pizza itself was not bad....however the dough/crust was somewhat different.......not in a bad way...but not the classic pan flavor I know....I would most definitely go back.I give this place a true 3.5 rating because specials are only online......they do not not deliver to where I live....and even though it was not bad crust was ""different""."
92,2,2,I was in the mood for pizza hut cause of watching the commercials but after spending $75 at this pizza hut I don't think I'll be eating pizza hut for a long time. The pizza was so hard it was like chewing on cardboard. I asked for marinara and garlic sauce for the stuffed crust and didn't get it. This was a waste of my money. I threw most of the pizza away the rest I gave it to my dogs smh
93,2,2,"This location is definitely not closed Yelp lol this has to be the nastiest pizza I've had in a while they put entirely too much sauce I had to eat it with a damn fork. Customer service was horrible girl had a nasty attitude and they took 1:30hrs to deliver the pizza, worst experience I don't think I could ever eat Pizza Hut ever again"
94,2,2,If I could give no Ok so I've seen commercials about the stuff crust pizza day in day out so finally today I order it for my family let's just say it was a let down nothing like the commercials the pizza was dry meaning barely no tomato sauce seems like it was over cooked and they didn't have the garlic dipping sauce come on now it was stuffed crust pizza that sauce should be a given the pizza wasn't even cut correctly had to go and get a knife to cut it myself then I ordered the stuff garlic knots those was horrible the marinara sauce was real thick and tasteless and the one that takes the cake i made sure I picked contactless delivery paid for it with my credit card added the tip via credit card and the man made me go downstairs to his car to get the pizza just horrible I will never order from this place again haven't had them in 10 years imma go another 10+ without it just nasty my 1 year old son even threw it on the floor off his high chair and he loves food smdh I'm pretty upset I paid all this money just to have a big let down today Happy Fourth of July to us
95,3,2,"It's Pizza Hut if you Mess this up you need to be fired. I def think they need to keep the customer area cleaner then they have it. Seems to tend to look like a mine hurricane rolled in.  Like I said besides that everything was as expected,  you don't come to Pizza Hut for surprises."
96,3,1,I haven't had pizza it in well over 10 years so I decided to give it a try and The pizza is good here the staff is super 3stars all the way and you get your pizza in 10 to 15 min # beats dominos time so far*
97,2,1,"It's been a rough week.... and it's only Tuesday.On top of that it's Thanksgiving week.  On top of that, I cook 5 nights a week in my home, PERIOD.  After coming in from work and helping with homework, energy zapped, all I could think is I don't wanna cook dinner. My brain was now screaming this sentiment to me, when the heavens opened up and the angels sang to me... YOU COULD JUST ORDER PIZZA.I Could Just Order Pizza!!! A smile widened across my face and I opened a window on to the Pizza Hut site.  My brain racing, I remembered countless emails and a brand new redesigned website. I excitedly rushed to make my selections , which aren't as easy to make as one would think , put in my payment information and placed my order, and then it happened.............................Your order will be ready for delivery in 2: hours and 20 minutes.  HOLY F*CK!! Holy F*cking Moley!! 2 hours and 20 minutes for 3 pizzas. Ohh Emm Gee......youcouldjustorderpizza I thought     -___-Two hours and twenty minutes...in 2 hours and twenty minutes lets see, I tired out and put a cranky one year old new to walking to sleep, I helped my son make a crazy hat for crazy hat day tomorrow, I softened butter for cookies, made 36 oatmeal chocolate chip cookies from scratch including changing oats to quick oats and chilling the dough before baking, swept my whole apartment, refilled the soap dispensers in the bathroom, went to the atm and bought a  gingerale.  ALL BEFORE THE PIZZA CAME.Of course the pizza arrived, stiff, congealed, void of any warmth(i've heard these words used to describe some mother in laws).  The bread sticks that came with the order , reminded me of home plate , with sand on it except square.  The pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, and it had to spend an extra 15-20 mins in the oven to get that way. ( Good thing the oven was preheated from making cookies :-)..)But of course,   I could just order pizza....or next time I can just take my happy ass in the kitchen, and just make dinner."
98,2,2,This got to be the most ghetto nasty Pizza Hut I have ever been to it's nothing but a bunch of junkies That works there the Pizza is so horrible stay away from this nasty pizza shop
99,2,2,"This past Saturday, I was in the Bronx for a kiddie party..... As I arrived rather late and noticed all the pizza had been eaten and many of us leftover were still hungry.....It was suggested we get some Pizza Hut, too bad I was not lucky enough for it to actually arrive.I placed an order online for four pizzas and breadsticks at 8PM..around 8:50 I started to wonder what was taking so long, by 9:10 everyone wanted to know what was taking so long. After 5 attempts to reach them, (all my other calls I got a busy signal) I finally got through. After waiting 10 minutes for someone to pick up, he tells me the wait time is 2 and a half hours!By now its about 9:30 and everyone is frustrated, fed-up, peeved, irked, or whicher other word you want to use. I just wanted to depart on my long drive back to Brooklyn, I decided to just cancel. I was placed back on hold just to cancel my damn order. After 5-7 minutes of waiting, I just hung up. What a horrible experience with this place!Thanks a lot Pizza Hut, I surely will not be calling you, next time I am in the area and have a pizza craving.."
100,2,2,"If I could give this place no stars, I would. I ordered a pizza from them last night and I knew something was off about the pizza. It was old. And this isn't the first time this has happened to me when I ordered from them. The crust and cheese was stiff as fuck. I can't even deal. I want to throw up with how nasty the pizza was. I'm never ever ever ordering from here again. And I actually want a refund."
101,2,2,Abysmal service that's impossible to avoid. The employees seem miserable and ready to leave.  Receiving a greeting is impossible. I would recommend avoiding this particular Pizza Hut if possible. There is a Dominos near by where the customer service is 5stars by comparison.
102,2,2,Very disappointing service.... My order was placed online (where they can literally READ it) and they still messed it up. Like really ? They employees seem bothered by anything you say to them. They carry looks on their faces that make one feel bad about interrupting them. I mean who is the customer here ? Who's paying for the service ? I'm sorry but as a corporation Pizza Hut has got to do better. With the amount of unemployment in the Bronx I'm sure they can find replacements for this lackluster bunch they currently have managing this lovation
103,2,2,I placed an order online processed payment with my credit card. Everything was good got confirmation by email that everything was paid food was on the way. My food comes the driver doesn't get out of the car. I walk to the car asked why didnt you come to the door she said its curb side service take it up with corporate. Then she said you have a balance please pay 31.01. I showed her my email confirmation that it was paid in full. Her response was to pay or I'm taking it back the food.  So I paid the cash instead of sending it back. Just because I didnt want to wait again for the food.  I call the office the manager by the name of ashely told me to bring a copy of my confirmation of payment.  I told her why would I come there if i paid to get food delivered. I asked for a business email pr fax I can send confirmation. She on to say they dont have one then she says I have a business phone send it to that.  No problem  I send it she told me to dispute it with my bank. So they know they just stole my money when they have a pizza hut confirmation that.
104,2,2,SAVE YOUR $$$$$ They should close this location down. They SUCK!!!!!!!! Starting from the Manager. That's the first person I will fire you for a run in this establishment the way it is I placed an order for two pies online at 7:05. They emailed me that my order was ready at 7:21. I got there by 7:20 and nothing was ready. I waited until 7:40 & nothing. Had to argue with the manager to get my 40 bucks back worse place EVER!!!!!   I'm contacting Pizza Hut personally go to Little Caesars much better and less frustrating.
105,2,2,"601 Westchester AvenueBronx, NY 10455 (718) 585-1401I will NEVER order from here!! The people that work there barley have any respect. The place looks dirty."
106,1,1,Very efficient and great service I want to add something different and they help me with it
107,2,2,"horrible service, order never delivered and after 2 weeks money has not been returned. Always placed on hold when calling, in one instance the manager said he was too busy and for me to call back tomorrow. lol."
108,2,2,"I HATED THE FACT I HAVE TO LIE & GIVE THIS PLACE A DAMN STAR!!!!!! Let me start by saying I Love Pizza Hut but, there isn't anything nice I could said about this one it is ABSOLUTELY THE WORST ONE IN THE BRONX!!!!! My husband place an order today at 7:05pm online as a carry out when he received the email that our order will be ready at 7:21 so he got there at 7:20pm to only be told 7 minutes No problem but, that wasn't true because here it is 7:47pm & still No Pizza!!!!!! The manger told my husband 7 more minutes meanwhile delivery driver's was coming in & out picking up Orders. My husband was Super Upset  ask for his money back the manger told him ONCE AGAIN 7 MORE MINUTES!!!!!! But Enough was Enough!!!!! We decided to NOT WAIT ANYMORE WE GOT OUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PLACING A ORDER CAUSE YOU'LL BE WAITING FOREVER FOR NOTHING!!!!!"
109,2,2,This location is disgusting!!! The pizza crust looked old and stale. Delivery came in 20 minutes but the food was cold!! I've ordered from this location a few times before and the food never looked like the way it did today! Never ordering from this location again
110,2,2,If I could give them a negative number I would. I ordered a few things yesterday and it took almost 2 hours. I'm not even complaining about that disgusting time but the fact that the delivery driver tried to start a fight with my boyfriend. Who does that? Horrible establishment.
111,1,1,"Mon-Fri, 11am-1:30pm, are there Lunch buffet hours. That is the only time I actually will go to Pizza Hut. Their food is good, but be prepared for greasy. Of course if you're a, Pizza Hut fan, you know that their pan pizzas are famous and are always greasy, so in other words you should know what you're getting and not complain about it. So yes, buffet hours are somewhat slim, and therefore hard to catch. But if you do, you will enjoy it. They serve 12 different pizzas I believe and is on a rotation. So once one pizza is gone, the next one in line comes, etc. They have 6-7 pizzas on deckdeck at all times, 2 bread stick varieties (cinammon and desert (garlic)). They also serve pasta and separate marianara for the bread sticks. When you come in for a buffet you will be seated almost instant. I usually go alone, so its even faster than if you arrive in a group. Upon seating they will almost instant ask you dfor a drink. Buyer beware, that drink is NOT included in your buffet deal. In fact the drink itself cost 1.99$ but luckily its unlimited refills. They carry Pepsi sodas, and yes, Dr. Pepper as well. A buffet with a drink costs 8.78$ before taxes and tips. My only 2 complaints are that: 1) the marinara sauce is often neglected and not refilled. 2) all 3 times I've been there this month, there is only one person waiting the tables and therefore if you want service it can be awhile. Even if one of the other employees sees you need help, they will just look down at the floor. I understand that may not be your job, but already notify the person who's job it is.Food I enjoy. I mean, I haven't been to a Pizza Hut buffet since the 90s. But its nice once in awhile.Oh yeah, and another thing. This pizza hut buffet only has a pizza bar. There is no salad bar!!!!Anyways, I will rate them a 4. Since their product is always perfect. Service may not be, but let's be honest, most people will usually go back if their food excels."
112,2,2,"Got the epic dinner box a couple of days ago for my family because the Burger King was closed. It was an unholy combination of microwaved pasta, barely cheesy cheese sticks and cardboard tasting pizza with barely any sauce or cheese. They even forgot to include the Marinara sauce for sticks which could have been their only chance of being edible."
113,2,3,"Walked in and asked to be seated, no one eating at all. Guy working said he was the only one there and we could order pizza, but not have it served to us. We could sit in the resturant and eat it, but would have to walk to the counter and get it when it was ready. They don't have a salad bar. He said they do pizza buffet during the week. Needless to say, we left."
114,2,2,"Sooo I just ordered the veggie pizza. HAND TOSSED, no cheese. . Now I know having no cheese on there isn't the reason for my pizza to look like this. I called the store, some smart mouth girl (working Feb 14th at 10:30pm) answers the phone. I tell her that I'm not happy with my pizza and that it's extremely flat and taste like cardboard ..She goes on to tell me that that's what I ordered and she don't know what to tell me.. I said ""hmm.. so what you gave me was hand tossed?! And I'm telling you I'm not satisfied and you tell me ""you don't know what to tell me"" ... okay. I said I'll call back when a manager is there to voice my concerns. She tells me ""well he's gonna say the same thing I said"" ... I said ""so he's gonna tell me, after I show him pictures of my tasteless ""handtossed"" pizza,.. that he don't know what to tell me"" ... okay we'll see. I honestly just wasted my money and I'm piseed. Oh I will be calling back until the issue is resolved."
115,2,2,"Do not go here. We wanted to change our order from take out to eat in. He went to ask, came back and said, ""no, you can't have it here--it was ordered for take out."" So I canceled the rest of the order (cheese sticks and drinks) and just paid for the pizza. I told the manager I was disappointed we couldn't eat there. He then told me, ""oh you can eat here, you would just lose the promotion."" He then told me how much it would be without promotion...not a problem, $5 more. The problem was with the inconsistencies of the waiter and the manager and what they told me."
116,2,3,"Why is this place still open? The resurant and restrooms were discusting. The server had one table, us! Upon arriving we were told to find a clean table, huh! Service was not bad, the server was friendly, its not her fault the place is ran like it is. The pizza was good.  Apparently cleaning anything is not required to work there. I'm curious to know if this is corporate or a franchise? The manager should be fired today for letting this place look like it is."
117,2,2,"The worst pizza joint around, placing an order for delivery was like pulling teeth! RUDE does not even cover it, From the minute they answer the phone, you'll wish you never called. The visit was even worse. The pizza was oily and the dough tasted stale. The restaurant was dirty and the staff acted like they could care less. No standards what so ever."
118,2,2,"The restaurant was dead when we walked in and got seated, then after a big group came in, we were asked to leave because they were too incompetent to serve a table of 3. Will never give this establishment my business."
119,2,2,"My mom and I went here last week, we were the only people in the restaurant with the two sketchy workers. Service was average, but after my mom paid, her credit card info got stolen and was used the day after. This was the only place she used her card, soo...if you go here I would advise paying with cash"
120,2,2,"Hello. When I placed my order with this location I was expecting to receive 8 breaded wings. Upon receiving my order I received 8 boneless wings. The wings were highly un satisfying in the sense that they were tough and slightly burnt. I immediately phoned the store manager eager to discover my options. The store manager informed me that I did not have any options and there was nothing he was going to do to rectify the issue. I was forced to keep a meal I did not enjoy. Along with the loss of $24.18. I value my money as anyone should. As my money was well earned I do not feel my money was well spent. I wish my experience were different. However, I do not think the store manager handled my concerns to the best of his trainings and knowledge. I am seeking reparation and would like to know who can assist me."
121,2,2,"The only way to describe my experience is: LONG AND DISORGANIZED!  This Pizza Hut is an utter mess, to say the least. The online specials were different from in store so I ordered while in store for pick up. There was a discrepancy with the order, where we waited 10 mins for the manager to come out and resolve the issue. No apologies. Nothing. We literally waited close to 1.5 hours for two medium pizzas and an order of eight bone in wings. Again no apologies. Now the young women cashiers were trying their best to accommodate all, but it just fell short. Not their fault, but I think it begins in the kitchen. Orders were incorrect, pizza were burnt (lady literally came back and asked the rhetorical question of: ""would you eat this?"" displaying burnt cheese on pizza. They did make her another one without any questions asked). What I think makes this place disorganized is the heater for the pizzas are for both carry-out and delivery. It causes confusion for patrons, cashiers and delivery workers. Its a brand-new establishment and there will be kinks. But what I experienced here was disturbing."
122,1,3,"I went to this Pizza Hut with my fingers crossed and belly empty when I saw the all of the great specials on the banners out front.   There was a lady waiting for an order when i came in.  The cashier, super busy and dry, but was nice enough to tell us that the main special of $10 any pizza was available only online.  No problem.... so to the car I went.  Ordered waited and was in and out in 20 minutes.  Pizza and wings were fantastic. Will definitely be back, but will continue to order online, that poor lady was still in there waiting."
123,2,2,Pizza Hut has to do better with whom they choose as employees!!The food I got today was not quality at all!!!!! They basically put no effort into my order! Very disappointed!
124,1,3,"Wanted to give this place a review due to the fact that they have some horrible, outdated reviews. I don't leave reviews often but when I do it's usually based on either a great experience, a terrible one, or a saving grace for an establishment. My partner and I were craving Pizza Hut so I came on yelp and saw that this location was the closest to my home. I saw that they had a mere 1 and a half or 2 and a half ratings and I almost changed my mind. I decided to read the reviews and the most recent one was from almost a year ago, everything else was from 3-5 years ago. So i decided to give it a go anyway. I ordered my food online and when I arrived my food was ready. The girl at the register was super polite and even gave my extra sauce for my chicken wings. I ordered a large pizza with 5 toppings, Stuffed garlic knots, buffalo wings and a cookie pie thing and everything was fresh, hot and delicious. It's hard to not judge a place based on their reviews but in my opinion, this Pizza Hut location is definitely worth a try!"
125,1,1,"Great experience! Ordered online and picked up, food was hot and delicious. Customer service was also good! Will definitely return!"
126,2,3,Tbh I thought Pizza Hut was good but maybe it's just this location . They got A 5$ deal going on and what not so I ordered me a hand tossed pepperoni and pineapple pizza with bbq and medium buffalo wings . When my food it honest to god look like they took all my shit out the dresser and just warmed it . Pizza was cold and thin . And don't get me started on my uncooked boneless wings . Had no sauce what so ever . Had the nerves to honestly send me that . I already think half yah know how mad I was . Idc about offering to bring a new pizza it's the principle that you shouldn't have to . My order should have been made with love and clearly you guys have people on there who don't care for they job and managers who clearly aren't checking work before it sent out . DO BETTER BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION AGAN !
127,2,3,After reading the reviews I don't know how this store is still in business. I though I was the only one who experienced not receiving their order. It happened to me on a Sunday where I never got my order and instead of learning my lesson I attempted to order from the restaurant again that following Thursday and of course... same s*it.This is incredible with these people. And to get them to answer the phone HA. Good luck with that!This pizza hut restaurant just messed it up for all of them cause I'll never order from any pizza hut restaurant again.
129,2,2,"Are you kidding me? You sold an uncooked Supreme Pizza where the dough is still stretching. Then when I called to tell you that you owe me a new pie, you told me to bring this one back after I have already driven 5 miles to my home. So, do you think I'm going to drive another 10 miles there and back for a $10 pizza? No rain check? 1) You lost a customer. What the hell kind of Pizza Hut doesn't know how to thoroughly cook a pizza? If you don't know that extra toppings add extra moisture, then you don't belong in the pizza business. If I could give you 0 Stars, I would. That is the absolute dumbest mistake a pizza place can make. You have to be really stupid to not know how to cook a pizza through before you serve it to a customer.2) You still owe me a supreme pizza and I'm going to get it delivered to my home for free with extra bread sticks for my trouble.This happened at 6:45 on June 5th of 2017."
128,2,2,"This place is the complete worst, order food online for delivery, food never came, called themMultiple time they stated my food was on the way, i order the food at 730pm, online status show it would be delivered by 9pm, food never came, they stop taking my calls, called them the next day and spoke to a ""shift"" manager who stated i will have to call monday and speak to the head manager who could help me, place is the complete worst, will never order from them again..... i wouldve give them zero stars but i had to elect atleast one."
130,2,2,"I'm VERY disappointed in the service because I actually LOVE Pizza Hut. I spent 30 minutes perfecting this pizza and its ashame I couldn't taste the fruits of my creative labor. Long story short, they never showed up."
131,2,3,Omg was so excited that pizza Hut finally opened in my area ..... the pizza was not up to standard it tasted like a knockoff frozen pizza the bread was very thick and  very dry the wings horrible I will stay with papa johns or dominoes
132,2,3,"The absolute worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. And I'm not even a big fan of commercial/franchise style pizza. However I like Pizzahut the best out of all of its competitors, Domino's and Papajohns. (Little Caesars not included yuck!) Anyway I put in a order to pick up on a night when I didn't want to cook so I thought I would buy something Good and Quick for my family....QUICK & GOOD is the furthest thing from this Pizzahut. After arriving to pick my dinner box up of 2 medium pepperoni pies. Bread sticks and Wings, I was informed that the wait will be 30mins-45mins to receive my food. Say what?! Almost an hour for pizza even after calling it in. At this moment I should have turned around.After waiting for almost an entire hour I got my food, from a girl at the cash register who seemed like the customers were all irritating her! One young lady came back and noted that her pizza was cold and another man came back with the wrong order.When I arrived home and opened my Pizza box I then realized my order was correct however my Pizza was in fact cold and the cheese on the pizza was burnt. I only gave this place 2 stars because the wings were a different touch from other pizza places. Not better, just different. The wings at this particular location are first fried THEN tossed in sauce. Which I thought was the only positive here. I will stick with the Pizza Hut in Ozone Park Queens."
133,2,2,The worst ever place an order online and patiently waited for an hour when i called to find out what was going on u was told by a young lady that it was cancel smh now where i live when something goes wrong with an order they notify you but this place didn't even care first and last time smh. Clearly customer service was not taught at this place
134,3,1,The wait is long but what do you expect for something new... Wings are good and the pizza is better than dominos
135,2,3,The wait is way to long . They are never open late night . The service is horrible. But the pizza is better than dominos. But they always seem to forget something that I order & I end up waiting longer for the rest of my food ..
137,2,2,the absolute! worse!!!!!!!! ordered at 5:04 food came 7:15! i'm all for freshly made pizza but damn!!!!! 2 hours you have to be kidding me
136,2,2,They delivered a burn up pizza and breadsticks with no sauce. Calling to get through take forever. They just need to shut down and horrible service.
138,1,1,I'm so happy that a Pizza Hut finally opened in my neighborhood I loved the pizza the service could be a little better but what do you expect they just opened
139,2,2,"Unprofessional is an understatement. I placed 2 orders online within minutes of one another and they were supposed to be done at the same time. I got there a few minutes late on purpose, and my wings were just coming out 5 minutes after my arrival. I asked about my pizza and was told that they were on 170 something and I was 180 something. Fast forward to 40 minutes later and I'm still waiting. I check on my pizza again and am told that there was no more chicken, no call or any type of notification whatsoever. The manager was at the register giving refunds and neither her nor the cashier apologized or even tried to make things right. Corporate was emailed as soon as I got home. Will never go to this pizzahut again."
141,2,2,"Horrible food . Everything tasted old and gross my children didn't eat it and the one that did had diarrea ,I called the store and they gave me a run around , never apologize for it or explained the most they offer was $10 dollars off my next purchase, I spoke to Sabrina that told me she wasn't authorized to give me a refund and the person that could was on "" vacation "". Very disappointed My advice don't eat from there if you don't want to waste your money"
140,1,1,"I didn't check yelp before ordering here- ordered straight through the app, had a prob ordering, called and they were great over the phone. Food was hot, fresh, and exactly what I ordered. I have to say I was expecting mediocrity but was pleasantly surprised with flavor! Ok Pizza Hut! Way to keep a long time customer happy. *thin crust pizza"
142,1,3,"Pizza Hut is a place that makes good pizza (and other things but I like their pizza more than all the rest). I read some of the reviews here and many do not give them best the best rating. But rather give them the rating more based on their delivery service, their customers service and such. Now I know that when you rate a place you consider many things. And me myself had some mistakes made on my orders. But in terms of fast food pizza, Pizza Hut is one of the best places for Pizza."
143,1,1,I really like the pizza quality at this location despite what the other reviewers are sayin.  I ordered a medium sausage and breadsticks and it was on.  This location seems to put on way more toppings than other locales so they're good with me.
144,2,3,"I have the unfortunate displeasure of living across the street from this godforsaken place.Many months ago I awoke to an extremely loud ear splitting sound. Although this is common living on Myrtle Ave, this sound didn't stop. It just kept on going... what I discovered were that some employees of this particular Pizza Hut seemed to be power washing something on the sidewalk. For hours. After a long shouting match eventually they stopped. The days passed by and I thought this was the end of my power washing nightmare. I was wrong.Last night (Sunday night) at 1AM I heard a familiar and terrible sound, like a hurricane was tearing up my sidewalk. Immediately I knew the power washing perpetrators were back. So after an hour of putting up with it I went outside to confront them. After screaming at the unfortunate employees who were had the burden of power washing thrust upon them by their capitalist pig bosses, I discovered the reason that they were committing this heinous offense, and the true reason for this 1 star review.Apparently, once every 6 months, they take the grills out of their ovens and power wash them on the side walk. Which means that for 6 months they allow all the grime of every pizza they cook build up on these disgusting hunks of metal, only hiring someone to wash them after there appliances have gotten so horribly grimy that to wait any longer would make those ovens the only thing more wretchedly sickening than the NYC subway system.I'm not one for noise complaints or things of that ilk. The noise of life is one thing that I love and appreciate about living in NYC. The daily sound of buses and garbage trucks are loud reminders that there are so many wonderful people outside my window working together in their own little ways to keep this city running. To quote the inimitable Jane Jacobs ""...although it is life, not art, it's may fancifully call it the art form of the city and liken it to the dance -- not to a simple-minded precision dance with everyone kicking up at the same time, twirling in unison and bowing off en masse, but to an intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole.""But is this really necessary?Like why do you have to wait till 1 AM on a Sunday when everyone is sleeping to do this? Why not set up some cones at PM and do it then? Or maybe clean the ovens with brushes idk like every week or so like any normal place would? God this place is as disgusting as it is offensive."
145,2,2,Be aware of the delivery guy he's a thief. He doesn't carry enough cash so he can keep the change. He took $12.16 from me talking about he didn't have change. Smh I'll never buy from here again. The pizza was good thou and it was warm. Sorry for the rest of the Pizza Hut crew who have to take the heat because of one person.
146,2,3,Loved Pizza Hut in the past always tastes good came to order some take out place was empty I ordered the special that came with 2 free toppings when I asked for extra cheese I was told that would be extra and was not considered a free topping wtf since when is extra cheese not considered a topping the girl explained it was company policy and not up to her. Guess I won't be coming back until they fix this ridiculous policy
147,2,2,"I kind of laughed as I was reading the other reviews of this Pizza Hut, but yes, this place really is comical in an ""Oh God, I can't believe I'm about to eat this"" kind of way.Rus walked in and ordered 8 wings and cheesy bread (didn't even get a pizza). It probably took at least 30 minutes for us to get our food, but that's not even what bothered me the most.The man in the back making our food didn't wear any gloves as he handled anything, he was also talking on his cellphone and going between touching his phone and food every few minutes. Gross.They also throw all of the oven trays into a huge garbage can. Weird.The manager was okay, but he seemed a little disgruntled whenever people would call.Sigh. Should have known better and trusted my fellow Yelpers! But do yourself a favor and get  your grub elsewhere. There's a pizzeria right across the street and their food never takes longer than 10 minutes."
148,2,2,"Disgusting pizza, I had a mushroom topping on my slice and I took it off and found a piece of hair under it. If I would of never taken that mushroom off I probably would have ate that piece of hair. Terrible service I had to wait 3 hours for the delivery as well. And the guy on the phone was very rude when I tried to place my order. Here is a picture of my slice. The pizza was also very cold and soggy. First and last time I'm ever getting pizza hut."
149,2,2,I really wish I can give this place a negative rating. I ordered a large two topping pizza and boneless sauced wings. The wings barely had sauce and the pizza had less cheese than the wings had sauce. The toppings on the pizza tasted like dirt and I immediately got sick after eating.
150,2,2,"I wish I could give this place -5 stars. People, please take these reviews seriously. This Pizza Hut is a dive. Delivery ran 1 hr 35mins late. When I called to inquire about the order they put you on hold for the longest time...give you a thousand and one excuses...and lie about your order having left already. When it finally arrived it was cold and with toppings I didn't even ask for. Honestly it was worse than little Caesars. These people should be arrested for serving garbage."
151,2,2,"Horrible customer service, order took almost 2 hours...  & i live down the block.  We refused the pizza and from domino's"
153,2,2,"Ordered delivery for cheese stuffed cheese pizza..told the lady over the phone to add some marinara sauces on the side..40 mins later it arrives with no sauces like I repeatedly told her to include and the pizza tasted like sh!t!! No, I'm not just saying that..it literally tasted and smelled like someone pissed in it and prepared it after they used the toilet without washing there hands first! They just used mass amount of salt to make it taste like it's been properly "" prepared""I was honestly disgusted that I payed such price and will never ever ever ever get close or even think about ordering from here!"
54,2,2,"I would absolutely give this place a sub-zero rating if I could. Another reviewer said it the best - THIS PLACE IS THE WORST!!! Incompetent, unhelpful staff who obviously gives the worst service ever! Please shut this place down...the only issue with that is this horrible staff would try to find employment elsewhere and bring other businesses down. THEY SUCK!"
154,2,2,"Well, that was even more depressing than I'd expected.Semi-understanding my fondness for pizza, my dear mother sent me a Pizza Hut gift card.Hey, it's free food, right?Wow, you can order online now?I walked over to pick up my pie, with vague childhood memories of cheesy satisfaction. Dominos was the terrible one, right?The shop is a bit depressing, and feels like the fast-food restaurant that it is, except dimmer and grungier than most.By the time I got it home, the pizza was already lukewarm. I had opted for the thin/crispy crust, which may have been my misstep; or maybe ordering olives/tomatoes/mushrooms instead of the safer cheese.Or, maybe, it is no fault of my own, and this place just makes terrible pizza. Worse than I recall Dominos being, worse than dollar slices.Limp, cardboard-esque crust, low-grade toppings, zero flavor. It wasn't even cut correctly.And the ""breadsticks"" were a square of pre-formed bread product with a film of butter or oil around the outside and poorly-indented perforations with which one is apparently supposed to separate the ""sticks.""Don't bother, even if it is free."
152,2,2,Two cheese pizzas with burnt cheese was not my idea for a nice meal. Why would they serve that....I think they reheated old pizza and then sent it to us.....not happy. This was the second time for carryout....nope ...never again.
157,2,2,"WORST PIZZA HUT EVER!!!!! We went to pick our pizza up so I can not speak on the delivery service. I can however speak on how HORRIBLE their pizza is! We got a cheesy crust pizza but they was no cheese in the crust. The pizza was limp and hard to pull apart. I ordered bread sticks. They were flat, chewy, and old looking. I will EVER EVER order from here again. In fact I'm going to tell Pizza Hut they need to look into this store because the product they are producing is WWAAYY off of the Pizza Hut brand."
156,1,3,The pizza is great but most of the staff is rude. Lol there is one Latina woman who's nice though. I guess the bad reviews are pretty accurate depiction of the staff.
158,1,1,"I got exactly what I ordered and it was delivered in 40 minutes just like I was told. Oh,The delivery person looked like my uncle"
159,2,2,This place is the absolute worst!!!! I called and complained to corporate and they felt so bad they emailed me a free pizza. I wouldn't eat there ever again. They can keep that nasty a** pizza wouldn't care if it was free.
161,2,2,Always try to give them a chance bcuz I really enjoy pizza hut but this has got to be the worst chain ever!! I asked that my food be fresh on delivery they guy said it get there when it gets there. How rude. Food was warm I'm never ordering here again ever !!
160,2,2,I wish it was possible to get a location negative stars. I have had nothing but terrible customer service from the shit storm of the store and I have filed a complaint with not only Pizza Hut itself but also with the Better Business Bureau. I have absolutely no problem going on every social media outlet and doing nothing but blasting this company and its manager Persaud for his deplorable customer service. my husbands family has that has been delivered to from this location for years and all of a sudden they no longer deliver within a mile radius. they lost a lifetime customer and I will do nothing and nothing in my power to get these people shut down.
162,2,2,"I ordered food here and had a super bad experience. There was a short girl with long brown hair working in the front on a sunday night. She was extremely rude over the phone it was no wonder I got hung up on twice and had a hard time ordering. When I got there to pick up my food, I witnessed her literally yelling and speaking extremely rude to every customer over the phone. Also purposely hanging up on people and loudly slamming the phone down; this went on dozens of times while I was waiting for my food. She was also cursing out loud in front of customers and just clearly full of hate for even being there. Such a bad way to represent the location and business. She was also super rude to everyone inside the store and had the biggest attitude on earth. I felt bad because you can tell she's miserable and hates her job, but there's something called professionalism which she did not have one bit. When I saw the way she was acting, I was SO glad she wasn't the one handling the food or else I would have walked out so quickly. Not only did I have to wait over 25 minutes for literally one tiny thing, but I had to listen to that monstrosity of an employee the whole time. That girl was the worst worker I've ever seen and such an embarrassment to the restaurant. I suggest they find someone that can handle a busy night and that can be professional because that was terrible and super ghetto. This place will always be a dump along with their retarded waste of life employees. It's only a matter of time before this shit hole closes down."
163,2,2,Okay so I'm the first to review this Pizza Hut. I ordered online with my boyfriend and I live only 5 blocks away from this place. I have a pizzeria right by my house but we decided to try something different. It took literally 2 HOURS for the pizza to come! We didn't even get a discount or an apology or whatever. Plus the pizza was cold when it got here. We had to warm it up again. Ugh. Never again.
164,2,2,took forever and the pizza came cold  it took over a 1hour and 45 minutes honestly the pepsi was better
165,2,3,Bruh I love the hut but my mom doesn't so I went with my dad today I was so excited until there were no workers there.idk if they were on break but all the signs were on.so yeah no more Pizza Hut
5,2,2,"This place sucks! It was extremely cold! Took forever to finally get our food. The food was not good either in my opinion. There is a reason why they have just one space heater in this place, two people working, and it looks vacant!  Do not come here!!! What a waste of money and TIMEEEE !"
167,2,2,"So the time is now 3:17 PM in the afternoon I decide to grab a quick bite while waiting on my medication from the pharmacy. Me: "" I would like a caesar salad""Pizza hut lady: ""Were out of salad""Me: "" Ok let me get an order of Mild wings""Pizza hut lady: "" We're out of wings too""ME:"
168,2,2,if i can give 0 stars i will! i just want to start by saying this place is terrible! I went in there to get an athenian salad  it was sitting at the counter for like 10 minutes I had to ask if I can receive it the person just ignored me and put the meat in the oven again causing it  to get burnt and then she gives it to me and I told her was to Burnt that if I can get a new one she ignores my question and just gives me a refund I told her I didn't want a refund I just wanted a salad that wasn't burnt and she refused to make me another salad. I also forgot to add before making my salad she scratches her weave and uses the same glove for my.salad
169,3,1,My son likes it so I can't say much.  It's an Express Shop in the Target here.  They seem to follow Target everywhere.  No long line today at least.
166,2,2,"HOW tf is this ""Pizza hut"" without any damn pizza,every damn day. This ""hut"" is pathetic and their workers are very lazy and disrespectful"
171,2,2,The worst! I was given plain bread sticks that was barely cut. The pizza was horrible and we were not given what we ordered! I strongly recommend not ordering from here!
172,3,1,Very average but still good. Any time you can get a couple of 3 topping stuff crust pizzas 30% off is a good deal. Light on topping but acceptable. Too bad they no longer offer anchovies. Easy parking too.
173,2,2,"I ordered pizza for my organization...twice, the first time I ordered about 20 pies and my order arrived 45 minutes late with no apologies....nothing. The second time I ordered 3 pies for a team meeting. The delivery driver told me to come outside because he could not find parking (seriously on National Holiday when alternate side of the street parking is suspended in NYC) so I come downstairs and wait. I called him back because I do not see him, but I see lots of parking spots....he tells me he on the adjacent street, he sees me....(pause). I prepaid delivery charges and a tip, yeah you need to ride around the block and bring that pizza to me. He seriously expected me to walk over to him after he was on the adjacent block and there was parking right in from of the school, not cool. And HE had an attitude...ok! I will not patronize this location EVER AGAIN.These reviews are a direct reflection of the service you will receive at this location."
174,3,3,Food came fast but the bread sticks were not cut all the way ... you can tell it was just a half assed order things thrown in the bag and it was not ass good as other places first and last time ordering from here .... 5.2/10
155,1,1,I had a really nice experience and I am sorry for the yelp reviewers that had a bad encounter. I ordered online and  total was 27.50. I thought I told the lady over the phone can she charge the credit card including a tip she said she couldn't so I was like ok will tip the person when they came. It came 30 minutes after I called and I was pleased. I gave the lady the tip and some extra for the fast delivery. The pizza was really good fresh and hot and the chocolate chip cookie pie was delicious! Maybe the people who were rude no longer work there and they got new people. Either way I order from this Pizza Hut alone and when I like something  I just keep buying from the same place. So I only order from this Pizza Hut now.
176,3,3,"Since the Empire location is closed, this is the closest option before Ridgewood Queens. I placed my order online and it was ready when I arrived.  The lobby was packed with kids and a few adults, all waiting patiently for orders.  The employees were friendly, and that was about it.  I noticed they didnt have one of the giant warmers for the food, hence my pizza being kinda lukewarm.  Parking can be touch and go (meters only).  If we're in serious need maybe we will come back."
177,2,2,2 hours since I placed my order and still no food. I really wish I would have thought to come here and read reviews prior to placing my order but.....alas. Thank god that I opted to make a cash payment upon arrival had I prepaid for this order I would be LIVID.Don't do it y'all!
178,2,1,"I will begin by saying I was extremely thrilled to hear there was a Pizza Hut opening in our neightborhood when the flyer was in my mailbox. I made it a priority to order since I hadn't had Pizza Hut since leaving Virginia 3 years ago. A lot of New Yorkers frown upon commerical pizza chains but Pizza Hut was more nostaligic than anything. Growing up in the South we would order a pizza on friday night and play video games until we passed out as kids. When I placed my order at 9:05 I was given a 9:55 delivery time. I completely understand this being automated so no biggie. When 10:32 came around and my delivery guy called. I gave the benefit of the doubt since it's new. He immediately apologized for it being late. Now I live on the 7 minutes walking from this place, and my pizza and wings were both cold. Not cold as in some warmth left trapped somewhere in the box, but cold as in my thin crust crispy, wasn't crispy. Cheese was dry, bacon was plasticky at this point. I was disappointed.  An hour and half wait time and 7 minutes away and I get cold food?I'm not sure what to really make of it all. But with little to no good delivery pizza options in the area, I've given up on one of my favorite pastimes. Other reviews seem to be on par with some of the same issues. Hopefully this will improve and management will reach out to those that have had bad experiences but until then, no thumbs up over here."
179,2,2,"I had to contact corporate due to the lack of service at this spot. They gotta stop working with door dash or have a better system for ""tracking orders"". My order never even came, i had to call 3 times to speak with 3 unhelpful enployees who either gave me attitude and basically had me wait outside for a delivery person whe never showed (i was told they were a block away, after 15 mins is when i made the second call and that was the same situation). It was a two and a half hour ordeal and i never got my food since the store stopped answering calls -which is understandable since they had closed at this point but like i said, i was waiting for a while and the order was placed an hour and a half before closing time.And the time before this, i had specific direction (which no other delivery person has issue with cuz it's supposed to help both the delivery person and myself ‍) to call when turning onto my block so i can meet driver outside and the guy calls me aggressively yelling at me about where i'm at and how he needs to go cuz there's no parking. That was whatever but this spot is trash."
180,2,2,"Wow why would you hire these people they have no customer service they are rude and they take forever just to make a damn personal pie all you hear in the back is ""bro"" ""bro"""
181,2,2,Annoying ass bitch ass employees...gonna say they called me and didn't when I did deliver
182,2,2,1 star based on the delivery alone. Delivery will take well over an hour to get to you and the food will be cold. And this location is less than 2 miles away.
183,2,2,I've ordered from the Pizza Hut 4x now it literally takes over an hour to receive the orders from here.. Absolutely ridiculous.. Slowest Pizza Hut in the history of delivery.
184,2,2,Delivery takes wayyyy to long ... I live 5 mins away from there ... & food was cold both times I ordered .... This is by far the worst Pizza Hut Ive ever had ... Wish they hadn't open it because they given Pizza Hut a bad look ... Maybe it will get new management & improve .
185,2,2,"I live in the neighborhood and was very excited to hear that a Pizza Hut was opening around the corner from me.  All of my experiences at that location were not pleasant.  No one ever answers the phone, there is always a longer wait time and most of all the customer service stinks.  People only go there because the pizza is very good.  I called and made a complaint at the Cooperate headquarters and was sent coupons for two large pizzas.  I went back to the location and the cashier did not even greet me she acted like I was on the welfare line NEXT she said with an attitude.  The pizza was very good I give it 5 stars but the customer service is horrible they really need to hire people with better customer service skills. No body wants to deal with other people's nasty attitudes.  Please think about hiring better quality staff,  sorry it's a thumbs down for me."
186,2,2,"The absolute f#*king worst food preparation and customer service. The woman that made my pizza slammed the phone down on the table, walked away and then came back an hung up on me and when I tried to call back, she re-routed my call when I was trying to tell her that the ingredients on the pizza were very skimpy. I am on the phone with corporate now. They don't deserve to operate under the name of Pizza Hut with service like this and they just opened; starting off on the wrong foot already. Been a customer for years. Never again at this location. Wish I would've known to check their reviews before ordering because they're all bad."
187,2,2,"Today at approximately 1345 hrs., I came into Pizza Hut located at 1501 Pitkin ave Brooklyn ny 11212 and was getting ready to ask the cashier what specials there were. Before I had the opportunity to get the sentence out the cashier, Millie, interrupted me mid sentence and stated ""we don't have specials this ain't the express hut."" I tried to explain numerous times that I've order the special pan pizza with 4 bone out wings but she over talked me every chance she got. When I went to my phone and ordered the special I was looking for and came in the store to pay for my order, I explained to Millie that I found the special I was looking for. Instead of her aploligizing for her rude and distasteful and ratchet ass attitude, she said ""well yeah Y'ALL don't listen. That's only online or at the express."" I again tried to reiterate that she never explained that to me and was very rude. She deflected by staring $9.24 is your total....swipe when you see the green light. All I could do was laugh at the brown tooth, disrespectful, foul mouth, foul odor, fire breathing dragon from game of thrones 'cashier' MILLIE. This is not the first or second time that I've had horrible customer service from this SAME Pizza Hut branch. I'm extremely irritated that I have to spend my hard earned money and be treated so vile. I'm so close to never ordering from Pizza Hut EVER AGAIN. You guys need to invest in adequate training for staff and stop hiring these ghetto ass stink breath hood rats!!!!! I will be copying and pasting this complaint to every social media outlet I have (Facebook, Instagram, twitter & yelp just to name a few)"
188,2,2,"Terrible service!!! My order came in late and was missing my order of wings. The driver had the nerve to say they forgot to put my wings in the bag and that I have to call them to send another driver to deliver. I called, the manager said we will get the wings within 20 minutes... 30 minutes later I had to call back... Finally the same driver came back with an attitude and of course the wings were cold! Will never order from that place again!!!"
189,2,3,"Messed up my toppings. Incredibly slow delivery time. Cold, bland pizza once it arrived. The staff don't have a care in the world, acting bored and annoyed. However, the dining area was made and set perfectly. Bathroom is very sanitary."
190,2,2,"Never order onlineI ordered online once after going to pizza hutfor years and nobody even started the pizza 4hours after I ordered and after all that I didn'treceive ant points, a coupon, and barelyreceived an apology I got one after explainingI've waited 4 hours! It annoyed me so much Ihad to make a yelp post a month after thishappened its a great place just horrible at keeping online orders"
191,2,2,This place is absolutely horrible! They arrived 1.5 hours early with my Super Bowl food and I scheduled this at 9am and paid in ADVANCE to receive by food at 6:30pm. They do not answer their phones ever and they are only 2 blocks away as I received ice cold food. How do you run a business like this? Pizza and wings are so simple as you use tons of frozen product! DO NOT order from here unless you'd like to be upset on timeliness and food quality as well no answers to your complaint. You lost a customer Pizza Hut. You are falling apart and now we see why your losing branches.
192,1,1,We used to be long time customer of Pizza Hut dining in but slowly stopped because of the slow delivery when we stopped dining in... and one time getting a horrible pie that was assembled poorly...BUT!!!!!!....We have ordered about 4 times in the past two months and have gotten our pizza and sides within 30-40 min!!!! We didn't wait hours like a few years ago. I waited a while to see if it was consistent or just a good day for them and it has been consistent the past 4 times with delivering! Good is delicious as expected from the hut!I'm not sure if owners changed or not but whatever they're doing to deliver as quickly as possible and fresh food they're doing right this time!!!
193,2,2,"I stopped ordering from this Pizza Hut a long time ago due to their slow delivery time and unprofessional service. Today my kids asked if I could order Pizza Hut so I gave in and figured let's try it out. It was early and a Thursday night so I thought it couldn't be too bad. Boy am I mad I decided to even bother! The order took an hour and a half to get here which I expected so I'm not even mad about that. What I am upset about is my card being charged twice and the way it was handled. I called the restaurant as soon as I realized it. First the person that answered told me that the manager did it twice by accident because she was in a rush so I have to wait 3-5 for my refund. I then asked to speak with the manager. I spoke with Anaisa. First she told me that Pizza Hut has a new system where customers are charged twice if you leave the tip on the card. I responded with that is impossible as this has never happened before. I insisted that it sounded like an excuse. Then she told me that the driver told her to do it twice because he was in a rush and had to go. I asked her how is a driver telling a manager how to process payments...she had no answer and went back to well you just have to wait 5-7 days. Before I was told 3-5 but that also changed. I told her all I really wanted was for her to take ownership of the situation. She would not. She told me to call tomorrow and speak with someone else. As if that was going to help. I now have two charges on my card for one delivery. Let's see when this refund happens, if it ever does. She ended the call with there was nothing she could do and that is just their system. Anaisa was unprofessional and did not take ownership of her mistake. Very sad when that type of attitude comes from a manager that is supposed to be leading a team"
194,2,2,I wish I could give them less that one star because believe me I most definitely would. If you're thinking of ordering from here DONT. Worst decision you'll make. Waited 3 hours for my order to be delivered. Every time we'd call the store to ask what was going on they would hang up on us. The one time we actually got to speak to someone she told us she would contact the driver and get back to us and never did. We got the pizza 3 hours later and it was cold. Worst experience ever this place should be shut down
195,2,3,Pizza it's great. Customer service is the girl that served me was very rude and in polite she literally threw the plates on the table might as well just have throw them from the kitchen and hit me with them. TERRIBLE.
196,2,2,"Horrible Service Overall. My delivery ETA boosted up to 2 hours and stood on Hold for 10 minutes when I tried to figure out why its taking so long for delivery. I prefer Pizza Hut over anybody else, but this is uncalled for. I literally will never order anything from here again! Crazy how one store will change your views on the entire company.."
197,2,2,"This is my first review EVER but it had to be done. We Will NEVER order from Pizza Hut, especially this one again ! My husband and I placed an order for one ( 1 ) large cheese pizza online at 8:24 PM, at 8:57 PM we received a text saying "" Pizza is out for delivery "" at 10:26 pm pizza was still not delivered. We contacted the store via phone two times 30 minutes apart and were told each time the pizza left the store 10 minutes ago which was at 9:40 PM. FINALLY I get to speak to a manager who is HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL, PIZZA HUT should be ashamed of the service she provides. She tells me "" It's not your fault, it's our fault, I only have one driver "" Well thank you for clearing the air and saying it's not my fault, obviously it's not my fault. She then begins to tell me she will issue me a $10 store credit for my next visit. At this point, I don't want the $10 credit because I know I'll never order from this s**t hole again and I damn sure do not want a pizza that has been out for delivery for over an hour. She then proceeded to tell me that for a refund I would need to wait 3-7 days, fantastic. So, we waited at this point over two hours for 1 cheese pizza that never showed up and now up to a week for the refund. And it's not about the money, the order was a measly $26, it's the principal of how this establishment runs a business and then deals with its issues. I would have given 0 stars but unfortunately that is not an option, so 1 it is."
198,2,2,Ordered a Hawaiian pie (ham and pineapples) waited over an hour for the pie to be done. Once I received the pie it only had the ham so I went back to get the right pie and what they did was throw on a pile of pineapples (which was only one 3 slices) and reheated it up. It was not a legit Hawaiian mix pizza. Pretty much half ass work. I do not recommend this location to anyone. Now that I looked at the reviews it explains a lot on top of my experience.
199,2,2,"Literally THE worst staff I've ever seen at a dine-in. Walked in, stood there for 5min before being greeted by a man. We asked for a table and the waitress said out loud ""ugh are you serious?"" as she dragged her feet into the back. I asked what time they closed, they said 11, but they are sitting people till 10.We walked in at 9:30, a full hour and a half before they closed and still the waitress complained? ""Why do people keep coming innnn?!"" sighing and rolling her eyes like a whiny brat. ""Are you sure you don't want to carry out?"" the man who greeted us asked. YES, I'M SURE! The female waitress pouted once more and we decided to just leave. Not going to be served by an unkempt baby who cries about customers (who put money in her pocket) BEFORE we even get to sit down."
200,2,2,WORST PIZZA HUT EVER !!!! Ordered 2 hrs ago still no pizza!! Been calling & they pick up & hang up on you.Rude people... don't order from this place especially if it's delivery/ takeout save yourself the money.This is the second time they've done this. Never ordering from here againTHE WORSTTTTT !!!!!!!
201,2,2,"I haven't had Pizza Hut in like 15 years. I don't know why I even got tempted. Absolutely awful - Pizza came raw! They sent another one, almost 2 hours between the first order and it wasn't even what I ordered... Don't do it."
202,2,2,Order at 8:25 PM two hours later still waiting for my order.. This is the second time I order from this Pizza Hut and second time we encountered the same issue except the first time the pizza never made. Terrible service!!
203,1,3,"Their pizza is delicious and there is not just that there is a lot of food to chose from.When you eat there,their food service is quick,but delivery needs some improvement."
204,2,2,"They are completely unprofessional ,, they allow the phone to ring over and over before someone actually gets it,, my time spent here I seen 2 people walk out from waiting to be taken care of. Ridiculous!"
205,2,2,"Do not expect effective service if you wanna go to this store. I should have yelped before ordering their takeout online. I ordered and went to the store. It took the cashier five minutes to get to me when there was only one lady before me, who also had an online order. After we both paid, the cashier simply left, without checking if our food was ready. There soon formed a long line not attended. I waited for another ten minutes and asked if they could check if my order was ready. It took them another three minutes to check, only to find out my food was ready and I saw the bowl of wings sitting in the waiting area when I first entered the store. So was the lady who was in front of me's pizza. Unbelievable. The wings did not taste as good as they should've."
206,2,2,First time ordering here and will never come back. Ordered online and was told the pizza would be ready in 15 minutes. I went to pick it up and waited in the restaurant for an hour. When I finally go the pizza it was cold and had the wrong crust and my boyfriend got food poisoning the day after. The service was also terrible and when I asked when the order would be ready the cashier ignored me and started talking to her friend.
207,2,2,"I've been a loyal customer here, but it seems like the service and products are getting worse and worse. After today's experience, I'm absolutely done with this place. Today is Super Bowl Sunday, and I ordered a pizza online at 5:30pm. It said the delivery time was 7:30pm, so I waited patiently. By the time 8:30 rolled around - an hour after it was supposed to be delivered - I called the place and asked to speak to the manager. She said that they hadn't even started making my pizza yet! She claimed that the high density of orders got them all mixed up and they were behind on all their orders. This was a whole HOUR after my pizza was supposed to be delivered! Meanwhile, we were all hungry at my Super Bowl party, and I feel like an awful hostess. The manager gave me a $10 credit for next time, but I think this may be the last time I order from this particular branch."
208,2,2,"This place is getting the one star because the food did eventually come. Although, when we ordered it said delivery would be in 35-45 minutes and it was about an hour and 45 minutes. When we got our food it was cold, and we were told instead of a refund all they could offer was store credit, even though we live out of town, are here on vacation and are leaving tomorrow. Horrible customer service."
209,2,2,Don't waste your money at this location. The WORST service and food I've ever seen at a Pizza Hut ever!
210,2,3,Well the second review starts by saying why do I have to wait nearly 15 minutes for the little kids that work here to take my order. After finally taking my order I waited a reasonable amount of time (lol). After the order came I had to consistently remind the young lady that there were missing items to which she bright everything but one thing but that's OK. At the end of the meal I had to get up and go and pay rather than wait for her to bring me the check because I would have waited there forever anyway this place is sub par but eventually it's customer service and standards will one day work its way up to that of a gas station
211,1,1,We frequently do pick up from here. The location sucks with traffic all the time but the pizzas are good! We always order online - 2 medium pizzas (10 ingredients) for $14 - a pretty good deal! Never had any issues with our orders.
212,2,2,I ordered over 50 dollars worth of food waited an hour and a half for it to be delivered it was completely cold and the order was incomplete. I called them up to tell them as was hung up on 3 times before someone told they could not do anything about the missing food except refund me and sorry the food was cold that was my problem. I ended up calling corporate and they gave me a link to file my complaint 2 days later I received a phone call from the manager who apologized and offered me a 20 dollar gift card before I could ask how i would use this gift card I was hung up on. This place hands down has the worst customer service i have ever seen of any place.
213,2,2,"Just like other reviews here, I have been ordering pizza hut for 15 years all over the world and this place is the worst I have ever experienced. Ordered my pizza at 11:37 am online and the expected delivery time was 12:07 pm. I waited until 12:35 pm and called the store. The phone rang for about 2 minutes but no one answered so I thought the store was closed. This lady picks up the phone at very last minute and speaks very unfriendly. I asked her if my pizza is coming and wanted some kind of an explanation why it's coming late but only thing she says is, ""5 to 10 minutes"". I was clearly able to feel that she didn't want to talk to me and I also didn't want to talk to a clerk with such attitude. I got my pizza at 12:55 pm, opened the pizza and it was cold so I had to heat it up in microwave (first time in my life putting fresh pizza in microwave). As I was about to pick up the second piece, I saw a narrow thing sticking out of my slice. At first, I thought it was cheese melted narrowly but as I pulled it out, I was shocked to see super long hair of a lady. I didn't feel like eating anymore so threw out the whole pizza. I promise I will never order from this place again and they should know that there are other pizza franchises with better qualities. I highly recommend you to order Dominos or Papa Johns if you are going to order from this Pizza Hut, since other franchises have very friendly customer service mind and high quality pizzas."
214,2,2,"Ha! Please, why did I even bother to order food from here. It's my own fault really. But is it that hard to hire competent staff to get orders right? If only I could put negative stars."
215,2,2,"This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever had. They always get my order wrong in some way, either forgetting items and/or messing up the toppings & ingredients. The pizza is always way too greasy and soggy. I seriously think one time I had spoiled pepperoni on my pizza because it was sour smelling & tasting. Pizza Hut either needs to drastically overhaul this location, or shut it down. I've had no problem with the service tho, they're at least nice on the phone. Also, most of the photos are from the advertising part of Pizza Hut, not specifically from this location, so they aren't really helpful."
216,2,2,Horrible service . Shame on you for the staff working there . Grow up and be very professional.
217,2,2,The worst service ever! I placed a pick-up order after a long Friday at work so that I could get in and get out. I arrived a half an hour later and my order was not ready. I checked in with the cashier 3 separate times and was told that my order was being prepared. I waited for over an hour to be told by another server that my phone order was never entered into the system! Stay away at all costs!
218,2,2,The service in this place is very poor and unprofessional they speak to the clients very harch on the phone and always like 2 hrs for ur delivery to arrive
219,2,2,"2 hours for pizza delivery, and everything came cold. Driver didn't even bother to read delivery instructions."
220,2,2,"I had the worst experience with this Pizza hut. They sent me a bitten Hershey Dunkers desert. It was absolutely disgusting, my appetite was gone immediately. I called the next day and the manager wasn't even concerned all he did was give me credit for the desert. My advice don't order from here if you don't want a half even desert!"
221,2,2,"If you're craving Pizza Hut, pick it up yourself. Otherwise let it be known that this was the worst delivery experience I've encountered and the pizza wasn't all that. Indtead, go to little Caesars and pick up a nice warm pie! Or, for the ultimate delivery experience and delivery, it's gotta be dominos baby! Thanks for ruining football night ""Pizza Hut!"""
222,2,2,The worst delivery experience I've ever had!  They deserve no stars.  The order took an hour longer than the quoted time.  It arrived incomplete.  The restaurant basically told me I could wait a few hours and get it later.  It was ridiculous I just wanted them to refund my cc for the food they didn't deliver.  They refused and hung up on me.
223,2,2,"I am glad , I checked out the reviews and did not go ahead. We waited for 10 mins with no one greeting at the entry asking us what do we want.It looks like the owner if this place doesn't care about customer service."
224,2,2,"I always check Yelp reviews before eating anywhere and I seen the 1.5 stars.  It's Pizza Hut.  How bad can it really be?  We go in about between 9-10pm on a Sunday and ordered a large stuff crust pizza with extra extra beef, pineapple, and no sauce on the pizza and sauce on the side for me.  The pizza comes out with sauce on it.  It has to be sent back.  It comes out again this time with sausage.  My boyfriend is allergic to pork and could've been a bad situation if we had not noticed right away.  My side of sauce never came either.At that point in time, we just had to leave.  The waitress took the order right, but clearly there's some seriously incompetent people working in the kitchen.  Our waitress and manager were very apologetic but didn't change the fact that we came hungry and left hungry."
225,2,2,"I wish I could give this place one star , ordered boneless wings which were undercooked proceeded to order the marshmallow brownie which took 30 mins to come out ( made us miss our movie) than when Rajatt brought it out , your local pizza hut manager he didn't bring us forks.  Never asked for refills we had to ask him and it was water.  Worse place ever worse service ever"
226,3,3,Surprisingly I never had an issue with this location. Although they do take long to deliver the food at times.
227,2,2,Don't order from here if you want your food quick. I ordered my food almost 2 hours ago and it still hasn't come. I recommend another pizza place that is non corporate due to better service. There are plenty in this area
228,3,1,"Among the cozier Pizza Hut establishments around. Pizza Hut is Pizza Hut. Cheap and to the point. Get some boneless buffalo wings, a pie, and call it a day."
229,2,2,"I placed an online order, was charged and my order never showed up. I called after an hour and a half and was told it left for delivery so should arrive soon. After two hours I called several times to cancel and get my money back but no one answered my calls. I hate that I have to give them a star. Worst service ever!"
230,2,2,"ordered pizza here a few times but last time i did was terrible. i placed an order thru the app, said it would be about 45 mins. i was on a time limit and an hour and almost 30 mins had passed. i kept calling and calling and calling, no answer. so i emailed pizza hut directly and got 2 coupons 4 2 free pizzas. it was great but to wait an hour and a half 4 pizza? no thanks"
231,1,1,"My daughter and I went here with my beautiful 1y.o. grandson on Saturday afternoon and I cannot begin to tell you how great the staff is (two amazing young women with great attitudes and more patience than I have seen in a very long time) along with the establishment being a mix of sports and kid friendly AND the food being delicious! They were really gracious and kind enough to redo our pizza (at their insistence) at no additional charge-the BBQ chicken pizza is out of this world, we just did not notice on the menu it had bacon which neither one of us eats. They really did not know how much we appreciated it since my grandson was a bit fussy as he just had a check up and two vaccinations-and my daughter is a new mom:) I can honestly say they are added reason to love Union city! Thank you ladies, you made our Saturday=)"
232,2,2,Had to wait 30 minutes for them to take our order. And then they came back to ask us again what did we order...talk about horrible service hopefully the food makes up for it!!
233,2,3,My nieces & I went there one night on a Friday & the place was dead. It took about 10-15 mins for us to be seated first off. There was only 1 girl at the front answering phones & wouldn't even look at u when u first walk in. Finally we were seated & given menus the waitress didn't even ask us what we would like to drink 1st she just took our order & took our menus & the only reason she brought us drinks was because i had to tell her that we wanted to order them. The food came out too fast it was like they already had that food ready to throw out because it was bad!!! The food got to our table 1st than the drinks did! Then after we left we all got home with stomach aches! NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK THERE!!! This Pizza Hut seems like it's not a legit Pizza Hut because the food didn't taste like it normally does from them!!
234,2,2,"If I could give it 0 stars and a swift kick in the ass, I would. Would never order from them again as long as they are in business. The customer service, sucks. The store employees don't even answer the phone to confirm orders."
235,2,2,"Honestly the pizza there is just plain horrible, service is a nightmare and everything there was just a tragedy, should I even give them stars? Of course not."
236,2,2,"The only reason why I'm giving this place one star is because I have to in order to write this review -_- this place deserves ZERO stars! Just got back from eating at this Pizza Hut and service was so terrible!!!! The waitresses don't do anything but stand around and be on their phones! My boyfriend and I ordered mozzarella sticks as Appetizers and a medium pizza. Well guess what? We got our medium pizza 40 minutes later but, no mozzarella sticks! Oh wait? Weren't the mozzarella sticks for appetizers? How long does it take to fry mozzarella sticks??! The waitress then tells us "" oh I was just waiting for the mozzarella sticks to come out before I gave you the pizza"" uhmmmm, aren't appetizers suppose to come out before the pizza? Of course I said ""I don't want the mozzarella sticks anymore"" then, as my boyfriend and I were eating, she comes back and says ""oh you want a box for what's left over?"" Mind you, we have like 3 slices left and my boyfriend had a slice in his hand and I did as well. Then 15 minutes later she brings the check? Umm aren't you going to ask if we want dessert? Of course not! About 3 families left upset and mad  when we were there! This guy even complained to them and the waitresses would go back to their little corner and laugh!  I swear, I'm never coming back here! And of course, we didn't leave a tip!!!! DO NOT COME TO THIS PIZZA HUt!!!!"
237,2,2,"Wow, what an awful awful experience yesterday for Super Bowl Sunday.  Been to this place many times to do takeout since it's just out of reach for delivery.  Service is generally late or delayed at normal times but it was bearable.  Yesterday though, it would have been better if they closed down because it would have save all the headaches for all their customers and save all the labor cost.I order my pizza online at 3pm for pickup at 5:30pm.  Ordered large supreme pan, pasta, breadsticks and fries.  Showed up at 5:35pm.  Seems ok since I was maybe one of 5 or 6 people there.  Give them my name, they say they are working on it.  Expected so I waited.  At 6pm, I gave them the push and ask them about my order, according to the person at the desk, they burned a bunch of pizza (lying?) so they are totally backed up.  By this time, there are now 15 to 20 people waiting.  They want to cancel my order since they said it'll take another hour.  I told them what is the fastest they can get my order done since I'm one of the earlier one there.  30 minutes.  I told them I'll wait.  In the meanwhile, the wait time for delivery is now 2 to 3 hours.  They are totally rejecting eat in customers at this point.6:30pm, they called my name, I expect my order done so I can leave.  They brought out the pizza, I saw it wasn't exactly what I order (Supreme) since it's missing a few toppings but I just want to get home with something at this point so I moved on.  I asked about my pasta, the cashier gave me a surprised face, ""let me check"".  F u c k...  They didn't cook it.  She wanted to take it off my order (.............mind blown, of course you should if you don't have it but where is my order?).  On one of the busiest day of the year, you sell two types of pasta and you don't have a bunch prepared?  What kind of operation is this? Ok.  So where is my breadsticks,  ""let me check"".   F U C K..........  Unbelievable.  ""We don't have any breadsticks at the moment.""  ""What, you don't have a huge pile of breadsticks in the back?""  What in the world.  My 3-year old can do better than this. So they gave me the pizza and the fries.  Fries that were ready at 5:30 and is now soggy.  I didn't have the energy to bother with it any more.  I just paid and got out and wanted to leave them to all the other angry people waiting in line.  I'm sure my kid will eat anything at this time since its late.When I got home, I found out my pan pizza is really a stuff crust pizza and minimal amount of toppings under better lighting.  The pizza looks like it was a medium instead of large.  So they can't even get one thing correct.  Well, they did, they got my fries correct.  Which are now cold and soggy and unedible.  I lost all mood to watch the game and had everyone eat some quick food that we heat up.  Worst freaking ordering experience ever out of years of ordering takeout and delivery.  Will not come back to here.  To sum up, on the busiest day of the year, they had 5 or 6 cashiers in the front, and maybe more than 10 in the back with who knows how many drivers.  The delivery part, I understand that you could mess up.  Burning an oven full of pizza shouldn't put you back any more than 20 minutes.  And it doesn't take 6 cashiers no matter how busy the place is to do the job correct let alone to do everything wrong.  Everyone customers and employees was literally staring at each other not knowing what to do.  I work at a place when I was younger that is just as busy, I could do the job at the desk with just two employees if it is done correctly.  It seems like the cashiers were totally at a loss and can't manage the queue at all.  They are all dumber than any cashiers that I have ever come across.I'm disputing the charge on my credit card."
238,2,2,Very disappointed bad service the servers were very nasty. They gave us a chicken wings without sauces.
239,2,3,"Came here because it was getting late and we were hungry, and wanted to get into the city after getting a bite to eat.. just got done driving 12 hours. Parking was easy, thats the only reason it got one star. I ordered garlic chicken wings, and the wife ordered a small pizza and some bread sticks. Our drinks came out right away, then we were forgotten about.. 15 minutes later I recieved my cold chicken chunks with some garlic sauce poured over them. about 10 minutes later the wifes pizza came out.. 10..20..about 25 minutes later the waitress forgot about the breadsticks. They were at least hot. Timing of the food was BAD. When you want to eat some wings and pizza together, dont eat here."
240,3,2,"#My friend and I were excited to eat Pizza Hut. We haven't had it in a long time. We grew up on this stuff in the 80's. But sadly, I guess Pizza Hut makes their pan pizza differently now. The #crust is different. It doesn't seem like it has that crustiness or flavor as if it was cooked in an oily pan. It's hard to tell from this photo of my mine though, because this is #pretzel crust. But the other pizza we had was regular crust and it almost looked like a non-pan pizza.Okay, my above gripe isn't this location's fault. But I will blame them for forgetting the #Sriracha swirl I ordered on it. Plus the delivery guy didn't want to ring our buzzer. He wanted us to come out to his car on the street. So I explained this to my friend so he would go down and get the pizza, saying the driver was a #dick. Then I realized we never hung up the phone call."
241,2,2,"Waited 2 hours for a simple delivery, one personal pan pizza, breadsticks, and a stuffed crust pizza, once the driver gets here, he's missing a personal pan we ask to see the receipt, the PERSONAL PAN PIZZA was deleted off the ticket, no phone call, nothing, completely unacceptable."
242,2,2,"I decided to eat at this Pizza Hut because the one on Myrtle is shut down & I had a good coupon.. The delivery wasn't able to reach to my house (16 minute drive) so I met them at a closer location which I didn't mind. BUT the wings were dry af, the pizza was completely soft and didn't have the garlic buttery blend crust I always get on my pizza & the marinara sauce was completely watered down. This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever ate & I'm wondering why the Myrtle location was shut down when this location should've been ‍ I'm 19 years old and don't do reviews but this Pizza Hut was so disappointing I had to. I don't suggest anyone to order from this location."
243,2,2,"My food was cold & I live 5 minutes away.... I wasn't feeling well so I decided to order in, & was very disappointed. The Marinara sauce was straight from the fridge. The delivery driver sat in his car outside my house for almost 10 minutes before delivering my food. He was very rude. Wish I could've tipped him after this awful delivery."
244,2,2,"If I could get 0, I would.I ordered delivery last week while watching my 1 year old daughter in my apartment building since it is a hassle to travel with a baby.  The delivery guy refused to deliver to my apartment even though I told him my situation over the phone as we argued. We have never had any issues with any other delivery service.   The delivery guy was just being incredibly lazy and rude. He forced me to come down or not get the food at all.  I had to come down with my daughter in hand to pick up the food. Was a total enjoyment to carry my daughter back up stairs while holding a pie of pizza.....  I have no regrets for not leaving a tip after this interaction. Food itself was pretty uneventful and lukewarm as well.  Last time I order from here."
245,2,2,Just ordered here today for the first time I asked for honey bbq wings for me and pizza for my friends( keep in mind the delivery guy got a $10 tip). They said okay and when I got the the order they gave me spicy wings. I called them back and the manager said they only have mild or spicy wings which they did Not say on the phone honey bbq is spicy . ...Wth?! ... I said How Is Honey Spicy??? He said we can give you credit and I said I didnt have anything to eat all day i just want my wings ..can you send me mild and I'll give u back the spicy. He said the delivery guy is to busy. I'm hungry and can't eat the pizza my friends ordered bc I'm allergic to cheese..Finally he said he will bring the wings and they never came!!!Fire the manager that worked Aug 5th 2018 during the 5:30 time! He doesn't deserve to be called a manager! Zero stars if I could!!! NEVER AGAIN
246,2,2,"The ""Manager"" was rude and obnoxious on the phone , called us liars . The pizza that was sent to us was incorrect and the tomatoe sauce was expired cheese wouldnt even stick to it ( work in the restaurant industry at a high level so able to tell these thing) end results the kids got sick and almost ended up at the ER for food poisoning. instead of being courteous and professional they decided to ignore our problem and sent us on our merry way. we have now reached our lawyer and will be pursuing actions.all of that because the staff wasnt trained in customers relations.... its a shame because its going to cost them much more than having sent back a proper one. Good job Pizza hut of fresh pond road. see you in court :)"
247,3,2,Ordered take out...guys in the store weren't overly friendly or anything and basically waited for me to say something before I was helped...pizza was too well done and not as good as usual. Disappointing
248,2,1,Was told to pick up my order in 20 minutes. Entered the store 5 minutes early and my food was ready!Thank you for really cold large pie pizza.Thank you for 3 of the slices missing a lot of toppings.Thank you for lack of cheese.Thank you for burnt black chicken wings.Thank you for not adding hot sauce as I ordered.I'm mostly thankful for the cashier not bagging my food and watched me bag it.Please do not mess around and have conversations (3 employees including the manager) when there's a long line of customers especially in front of the register area. Looks very unprofessional and as if your store is a slacker.I would not hire any of the employees there if they were to apply at my company. Harsh but must be said after my annoying experience today.
249,2,2,"Ok so I'm a Pizza Hut fan, when I heard that there was one on fresh pond road I said ""move a side Boston Market"". Some locations are not made to represent a company and this store is one of them. I arrived and ordered a veggie personal pie. The store was combined with KFC  I don't understand how this place is still surviving.  When you don't have that many stores open I feel the customer service should be outstanding.  I called and spoke to crystal about Paul Joshua who made a mistake in my order.  Instead of an apology I got excuses and attitude. I was upset but I blamed my self I should have spent my 27$ at Boston Market."
250,2,2,"called to ordered food for delivery. after taking my order, the guy asked for my address and tells me ""nope you're too far"" meanwhile I've ordered from here plenty of times before. I only live 10 minutes away. he was rude to top it off. the customer service is horrible. never ordering from them again! I'll go somewhere ""closer"" because they're lazy"
251,2,2,"Service is absolutely horrible. They never get the orders right, they charge for delivery, and the delivery person has been known to honk his horn out side of homes, and expect the people to go to the car for the food. The place is filthy dirty. And the appearance of staff is sicking. I give this place an F and the doors should be locked by the city health department...."
252,2,2,"If these assholes could sell raw brownie dough they would. I ordered for pickup and they told me it would be ready between 10-12 minutes. I got there in 17 and expected the brownies to be ready, only to find out they weren't. That was ok though. I get home to indulge and as I'm prying the pieces apart I realize the brownies are way too gooey and that the dough is practically still raw. Now I have to put it in the oven myself and wait to eat them. Very careless staff."
253,2,2,"Staff is ok  The overall appearance of this place is dirty filthy disgusting floors are filthy black, soda machine is always overflowing with ice, tables and chairs unsanitary and wait time for food is ridiculous"
254,2,2,"I placed an order today 2- 8 piece wings (simple.. So you would think) . The order was placed at 1:34pm on the Pizza Hut app- confirmation specified the order would be delivered at 2:04pm not 2:15-not 2:34... The pattern that THIS particular location has consistently shown is inconsistency. Why every time I place an order the service gets WORSE ... the employees sound like we make their ears bleed when a customer is dissatisfied- ( I'm sorry that's what happens when you're not effective at your job) FIND ANOTHER ONE THAT MAKES YOU SMILE :) I called and immediately cancelled the order. I told the employee the customer service is poor and lazy. And it's tiring to put up with this : you do this pretty much each time Pizza Hut. He didn't care, didn't apologize and asked, "" what's your number to cancel?"") in one ear and out the other smh. The driver called with my order as I was hanging up and I politely told him "" you can turn around, the order has been cancelled "". Dear PH- Don't think you're going to walk up my steps with LUKE WARM WINGS 30 mins late. BISH where ?! I like my wings fresh and crunchy. Not cold, LATE. & wet. I work in the customer service industry. I deal with the shit too but don't fuck with my food. Because you'll be damned if someone fucks with yours. :)"
255,2,2,"Ordered one afternoon, called back 40+ mins later still waiting for my pizza, and they said they couldn't deliver it because I lived too far?! Couldn't have said that when I placed my order? Plus, they have delivered to my address before. What a joke."
256,2,2,This happens a lot where you order 10 or more and either they miscounted or just deliberately short you of two pieces of the chicken I don't trust this place.
257,2,2,"Where do I begin.....For the last 2 years I have lived on this side of Jersey City, and everyone in the West Bergen section knows that food eatery options is very limited. So here we have Pizza Hut....First, never order delivery!! Always take out if you want this food. Delivery takes FOREVER and in addition, the your rolling the dice with the food. I have had times when the food came extra soggy and disgusting or burnt and dry. At least with pick up, you can check the food to make sure it is ok or have them make another. Sometime you think by ordering Pizza Hut, you would get a deal or Promo pizza but no, the cost for the pizza always comes expensive. It is as if the staff just does not care, but in their defense, this is fast food pizza so I am sure there is but so much they can do with the food but follow the cooking guidelines. I recommend that you just stay away to be safe but if you really need the Pizza Hut flavor, order bread sticks and a personal size pizza."
258,2,2,Where do I begin worst unprofessional staff and to top it off told me my order would be done in 20 minutes which turned into 50minutes never again 2nd time here and the same thing make you wait forever ‍ never ever again if you have a hour to waste waiting for pizza I recommend this place
259,2,2,"Upon my better judgement I attempted to order again years later, and this time my order just never came. And when i called multiple times to even check on the order or cancel it I was ""transferred"" to another line that no one ever answered and eventually just hung up."
260,2,2,"****YOU'VE BEEN WARNED****We placed an ordered. Didn't get it until 2 hours later and it was COLD not even cooked all way. To add insult to injury, there a few items still missing. My boyfriend and I spent  the next hour and a half on 2 different phones trying to speak to the mgr of the store. A representative would come to the phone after 20-30 mins of being on hold... Oh I forgot to mention we called 9x! We asked every time to speaking to a mgr and were told that we would need to be transferred. ""Transfered"" the phone will ring and then hang up. Just to recap, THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAPPENED 9x!!!We tried the delivery guys cell phone number hoping this would help. It did, so again we asked if we would speak speak to the mgr. I guess by then the gentleman was already back at the store and he handed the phone to the the mgr Nyema. FINALLY getting a helpful person on the phone. The result of all of this was that the mgr was able to refund the money back. After expressing the disgusting customer service, we were asked if we wanted a store credit! Ha, absolutely not!  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PIZZA HUT. Horrible customer service!"
261,2,2,Found a long grey hair in my p'zone. Disgusting. I pulled it out thinking it was a strand of cheese and then proceeded to feel nauseous when I realized it was actually a hair and I had almost finished the p'zone.
262,2,2,WORST Pizza hut ever. 2 hours+ for our delivery. Pointless/useless customer service person answers to transfer me to a manager that never answered.
263,3,3,"One of my guiltiest pleasures. You can not go wrong with their Supreme pizza and Breadsticks with extra seasoning. I decided to try their new Hut Favorite Flavor Sticks-- classic breadsticks with a garlic buttery twist. It was pretty good but I'll be sticking to the classic. The upgraded version was a little too salty.This location has been consistent for years. Food is made fresh and is always exactly what I ordered. Id recommend takeout. Can't speak on delivery but their seating area is limited. One downside, they now charge for extra seasoning on the breadsticks."
264,2,2,"Ordered via the Pizza Hut app: 9:35pmStated estimated delivery time: 10:04pmCalled to follow up: 10:17pmPhone rep stated driver had already left.Received call from driver: 10:41pmOrdered 1 stuffed crust pie, 16 wings, and the Chocolate cookie pie.Chocolate cookie pie was not warm when received. Since it came in a foil tin, we popped it in the oven as we ate so the cookie pie will be warm when it's time for dessert.Main complaint: Length of waiting time and room temperature cookie pieWill I order from here again? Most likely yes. Why? Because it is the only Pizza Hut in my area that will deliver to my house, and Pizza Hut commercials do a fantastic job making me crave them. I'll just have to keep in mind that I am going to have to WAIT."
265,2,2,"Usually don't have a problem but this was ridiculous. Been traveling all day back from vacation and decided to pass on food at the airport because we wanted to get pizza hut at home. Delivery took well over an hour and when finally got our food, the big dinner box, the pasta was completely overturned on one of the pizzas. We called to complain and see if we could get another order sent, was told no it's too busy and we'd only get credit for a later order. Completely unprofessional and the delivery guy definitely sold the pizza box and acted like it didn't happen. Won't order from here ever again, I'd rather go with dominoes."
266,2,2,I have placed an order online at 8:54pm and was supposed to receive my order at 9:25pm! I waited and called the store at 9:55 pm which I spoke to someone and the young lady said it on its way I asked how long she said wait another 15 mins ... its 10:30 and I still have not receive my food I find this ridiculous and poor customer service. Called the 1-800 number and that was pointless will never order from this location again!
267,2,2,"The Driver was nice (the only reason for a single star). The Large pizza was clearly a medium in a large box and the dough wasnt fully cooked properly. I called back to be put on hold for five mins, they are busy. I spoke to a employee who handed the phone to a Rude manager who doesnt greet me at all. Instead he says ""we sent you a large, that is a large"" ""you want me to make you a pizza myself ill do it"" as if it is my fault. this location has changed for the worst. This isnt my first bad experience however it will be my last.1. Poor food quality 2. Poor Mangment Pizza hut like other chains train employees and this manager needs retraining (in guest interaction)"
268,2,2,just got my order..pizza is hard like cardboard and pasta smells like moldy cheese..this location needs to be shut down ...
269,2,2,I will never order from here again. Waited for.my original order for over an hour. Then when it gets here the pizza isn't fully cooked in the middle. Nothing but mushy dough under the cheese. I call back and they agree to make me another one. Then I have to eat over an hour for the second one. This one gets here and although more cooked than the last one still not completely done in the middle. Thank God my kids eat the topping before they eat the breading other wise they would have been so sick. I try to call back and spend 20 minutes listening to the phone just ring. Its 8 o'clock they don't close til 11. Finally the same girl picks up and I'm irate. I want a refund. She says she has to call the driver to bring the pizza back so I can get a refund. It is now almost 9 o'clock and still no sign of him. They have lost me as a customer for good!
270,2,2,Ordered a Large Ultimate Cheese pie & 16pc boneless garlic parmesan wings. Took 2 1/2 hours for delivery service. During multiple calls to find out status of delivery my calls were disconnected. When my food arrived everything was COLD! Another call was placed to inquire about a refund or picking up HOT food I was told I can only receive store credit on the phone number I was calling from. HORRIBLE service! Pizza Hut on Rt. 440 is WAY better!
271,2,2,This place is HORRIBLE they get your internet orders wrong! How is that possible? Then another hour waiting for delivery because they messed up! I let them know 2 hours is un except able they offer a free pizza really? 2 hours later for a half a meal no I want my money back... The driver was nice the only reason for 1 star.
272,2,2,"Do not! I repeat do not  call and order from this Pizza Hut. You never received your Pizza. I had the misfortune of calling this Pizza Hut and placing an order that never came. When I placed my order I was told it would take 30 minutes. I called back nearly an hour later and was told the delivery guy left 30 minutes ago. I only live 10 minutes  away. Nearly 3 hours later when I called yet again, I was told that I never placed an order when I know that I did and had 2 witnesses. This pizza hut is horrible. I will no longer be ordering from them."
273,2,3,"I went here for lunch today with a co-worker.  I had the personal pie she had breadsticks, and we both ordered a soda.  Cheap and simple right?  The bill came at $13.98.  My friend put down $5 bill and a $1 bill to cover her portion, and I layed out a $10 bill and a $5 dollar bill which totaled $21 dollars...are you with me?  My intent was to receive change so I could leave a 3 or 4 dollar tip.  The waitress never came back to return my change.  I had to ask her to bring it....then she proceeds to drop of a $ 2 dollar bill and 2 cents.  WHAT?  Where is the $5 to total $ 7 dollars owed to me in change?  I asked at the front counter and SHE rather the waitress and the girl working the register said that I did not give them a $5.  That I only gave them a single and then $15, which is an outright lie.  I told them that someone either took my $5 or they lost it in the drawer.  They proceeded to argue with me saying that they did not take it and they counted the drawer and it is not over.  I asked to speak to a Manager at that point which there was no Manager on site for the day.  They gave me his phone number and said to call him then in the morning, he will be in.  I intend to do so and at this point it is about the principle!  I hate wating my time fighting over stupid stuff like this with a restaurant or anyone for that matter, but I KNOW and my co-worker KNOWS what amount of money we left to pay our tab.  So since most likely, the waitress stole my $5 dollar bill, she got $0 for a tip.  I think $ 5 dollars is a great tip for a $ 13.98 tab.  DO NOT ENTER THIS ESTABLISHMENT UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR MONEY STOLEN.  GHETTO, DIRTY, GROSS, AND THIEVES WORK THERE."
274,1,1,Good Pizza hut. Kind of hidden as it's a Taco Bell/Pizza hut on 125th. Small little place. Service is good. Usual pizza hut taste.
275,2,2,"On April 14th at about (9-9:30pm) I stopped in at the Taco Bell Express Pizza Hut on 125 street. First of all it took about an hour for me to receive my order (a single personal pizza) after which I sat and ate. To my extreme disgust I happened to see the same woman who made my pizza sitting on the prep table, shoes off, socks pulled back, scratching at her feet with a tape dispenser and then her bare hands as if her life depended on it. Of course it had to be the tape dispenser she uses to tape the receipt to the pizza box. My stomach turned as I realized the same hands she's itching away with are the hands that made my pizza, probably sprinkling her toe fungus in with the cheese. It didn't help that I watched her make my pizza with no gloves on, which I didn't even think to question until I saw this display. After seeing that I snapped a quick video I asked the only other employee who the manager was and he just looked over to her to get her attention instead of telling me her name. I walked up to her and kindly asked for her name to which she exploded saying ""I saw you recording me, go ahead post it, I dare you"" (so here we are) after asking her name few more times she finally revealed to me her name was ""Sonya"" it is an outrage that anyone in the food industry would behave in such an appalling manner. I Have been calling corporate and the operator keeps saying to call the store directly but they don't have a number for me to call !"
276,1,3,"It's been about a decade since we have had Pizza Hut. All the marketing had me craving for a minute.  Broke down and ordered an original crust plain cheese and an original crust meat lovers. It was exactly as I expected, yummy but greasy. The crust was crisp and crunchy. Cheese was lightly golden toasted. The meats were juicy and flavorful.  The accurate ratio of toppings were evenly distributed. It was a take out order and prepared in the time that they estimated. The employee at the counter was nice and attentive. I decided to place my order online and review all of the promotions available. After choosing which special I wanted, picking all the toppings, filling in all my information and finally my zipcode  I was directed to the closest Pizza Hut store to me. I received a message stating the promotion does not apply to the 440 Jersey City location. I felt like I may have been hornswaggled so they lost half a star."
277,2,2,"They don't even deserve a 1 star. Worst a service. Especially during pandemic. They kicked out a mom with kids and said We can only have 4 people at a time.How do you expect a mother to leave her child out, you should ask other customers to wait outside.They messed up the order twice apparently the worker there doesn't understand full pie with 2 toppings and add half mushroom on top is this hard to understand. Oh mind u they were screaming on top of their lungs. No type of respect for customers. I asked for credit and they told me to wait until they take all customers."
278,1,3,"Very long time since I've been here, last time was maybe as a child when hudson mall had an arcade. Well to make things clear, I could remember the pies being larger than they are now lol. I ordered a medium pizza, topped with chicken, onions, and mushroom....i started off though with plain buffalo wings no sauce...they were boneless, more like popcorn chicken. Meal was made fast and kept me on the move as my my lunch time is only a half an hour"
279,1,1,"Pizza Hut used to be the spot back in the day. You know - the Sunday funday that your parents took you to close out the weekend every once in awhile. I still have fond memories of the stuffed crust pizza and I can't believe that it didn't catch on in other places. Maybe YUM's lawyers have the patent on lock. Who knows.Anyway fast forward 15 years and lo and behold Pizza Hut has introduced a new type of stuffed crust pizza: Garlic knot stuffed crust pizza. If I could summarize my review of this pizza in two words, it would be ""the truth"". Yes, this pizza is the real deal. It is every bit as delicious as it sounds and just by writing this I am already mentally committing to returning next week for another pie. Yes, pizza snobs may turn their noses at the thought of purchasing a chain restaurant pizza. And in most cases, I would agree (especially with a preponderance of pizzerias in Jersey City Heights as well as Hoboken). However, the garlic knot stuffed crust pizza is a game changer. You owe it to yourself to check it out. (disclosure: I do not own any YUM stock)"
280,2,3,"This pizza hut has been around for as long as I can remember. Its kind of dingy, and old. They need to come in & revamp it. All the furniture are dated. Service is decent tho. The food is eh. We got the special that event, 1 large pie with 1 topping and 1 order of wings for 19$ (as per my SO craving pizza hut for some odd reason) We got their deep dish with chicken and mild buffalo boneless wings. The pizza was super oily but the crust was great, super crispy. The wings kind of remind me of a knock off Buffalo Wild Wings. Probably going to be another couple of years until I come back again."
2,2,3,"Go here if you like ghetto bums bugging you for stuff at all angles.  If you get lucky, they'll even help themselves to some of your food!"
282,2,2,"I didn't get to eat because I experienced a series of unpleasant treatments coming from the waiters and the manager himself. They were inattentive and when you do have their attention, they're rude."
283,2,2,The service has gone downhill quickly. Too  many other people were served first after us. I had to get management to get our order or else it would have been left behind. Not coming back again.
284,3,3,"Tip: Try their lunch buffet, it's cheap and has a variety of food. Pro: Orders are always accurateCon: Not the most professional employees Not much to write here, most likely like your typical Pizza Hut. I've been coming here for many years since I was a young kid, but mostly takes it now. The food is standard as any other PH location, however not there most professional service. Aside from that, no other issues- the order is always accurate and I get exactly what I ordered."
286,2,2,"I am so happy to know pizza hut because if this were my first time I WOULD NEVER RETURN! This place is a poor excuse for pizza hut and I nor my girlfriend, family or friends will ever return. Pizza came out room temperature which I cannot understand since it is made fresh. The cheese had no stretch to it, there was barely any sauce and the quality of the ingredients were poor and the pizza was made poorly. The pizza as it got colder than what was presented to us began to smell horribly. THIS EXPERIENCE WAS HORRIFYING. Our server was nice although it seemed as though he really was the only one working but even his service couldnt convince me to come back. Nope, I'll take my business elsewhere."
285,2,3,"Went today with my family. The bread sticks was cold. Pizza was ok. Very greasy. Pizza Hut have changed a lot. Serve was good. But, food was not. For the price I paid, I've could have gone to The Cheese Factory and paid the same price for a family of 5. (2 Adults 3 small kids. Kids share big meals). Not going back."
287,1,1,By far the best employees. When I was pregnant I would come here late night and get my Hershey's cookie and they already knew who I was when I called ahead ( preggo cravings lol ). They were always so friendly and helpful. I still love coming even after the pregnancy.
288,2,2,"Worst pizza I've ever had. Called at 6pm for a pickup. Asked how long does it take to make a pizza. Albert said 10 -12 minutes. Told him I would not be there until 6:45. He told me they would not start my pizza until 6:30. My first error was trusting his word. I get there at 6:35 and my pizza is ready for pick up. My second error was not checking it at that time. Drove home which took 10 minutes. Half the za had 3 of the ingredients I asked for, the other half had only 2. And it was COLD. I had worked all day and just wanted something to eat. I had not had Pizza Hut pizza for a long time and was really looking forward to this pie. I actually like cold pizza so I thought it would be OK to eat. I was wrong. Bland  ingredients & a greasy crust. My third error was not taking it back. Regardless, I'll never go there again."
289,3,2,Not like before. They still have the buffet. But the quality of the pizza isn't that good. The cheese falls right off and it's very saucy. Not cooked fully.
290,2,2,"Horrible. If I want an imitation New York-style pizza (read: super thin, wide slices with very little sauce) then I will not order from the biggest pizza chain in the country. Pizza Hut is my favorite pizza chain, and never before have I ordered from a location that did not deliver the same pizza I have eaten for 20+ years. That's like ordering fries from McDonald's, and they hand you seasoned fries with cheese on it. Who gave this Pizza Hut franchisee permission to rewrite the pizza recipe? Horrible, and I am so disappointed that I cannot order delivery from Pizza Hut as long as I live here. Smh."
291,2,2,Don't go here it nasty and dirty and the manager Casey is disgusting very rude and unprofessional. I wish I can give them a 0
292,2,2,"We went for dinner, half of the tables still needed to be clean. Workers were very rude especially the waiter Shady and not accommodating, wait time 30 min for them to take our order after being seated. Would not  recommend this place."
293,2,2,"We were just berated by a male employee who started lecturing us that we could not take a brownie dessert off our pickup order, otherwise it will ""mess up"" the computer system. As soon as we hung up from ordering, my husband said we didn't need to get the dessert in order to get the special. So I then immediately called back and ""attempted"" to take it off our order until a male employee was unneccesarily rude and told us the pizza was already in the oven. How that makes a difference of why we couldn't take the dessert off the menu beats me?!?!He started getting loud and obscene. I asked for his name. Click. He hung up on me. We called back to speak to the manager whose name is Rose. She wouldn't give his name. I love Pizza Hut, but this just bites the dust. Pizza Hut needs to implement policies on the behavior of employees, have a thorough interview and check up on their employees and managers, because there are no words to even describe how we feel. We're just trying to order a freakin pizza!"
294,1,3,"I've tried pizza at nicer decor restaurants, I've tried pizza at local restaurants, and I've tried pizza at chain restaurants.When it comes to a plain pepperoni pizza on regular dough, no one comes close to Pizza Hut.  Something about their combination of herbs that makes it vastly superior.Some Pizza Hut locations are a little off on the flavor, but this is one of those that gets it just right.  Too bad they don't deliver because the area it's in."
295,3,2,"I went here for lunch a few days ago. I had no idea pizza hut still did the lunch pizza buffet. Well let me tell you, it aint what it used to be. I remember alot more different kinds of pizza, salad, and maybe a few desserts. Now the entire buffet consisted of just 6 pizzas. Meat Lovers, Veggie, Pepperoni, Cheese, and 2 others I don't remember. They also had their pasta there which was disgusting (in my opinion) and that was my first time trying it. I thought there used to be a small salad bar, maybe a lil dessert perhaps. NO, not here. I took a pic of the entire buffet so you'll see what I mean. I guess I cant really complain because it was only $6 pp. Now the pizza itself was good as to be expected from pizza hut. The staff was nice and always close within ear shot. It seemed like our waiter was also the manager, not sure why just had the feeling. All in all I was shocked by the lackluster buffet, but even without other items, cant beat it for $6. Also I couldn't check-in here, the address is says it on 440 but that's it, no unit #. Anyone else have this problem??"
296,2,2,Probably the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to.Something about this place is so depressing.Nobody smiles nobody talks and they all walk like they were zombied out or something.They really need an energy boost or just hire employees with a little more enthusiasm in life.I saw one of the guys changing the garbage bags and you would have been shocked to see the time he took to replace each one..I got a personal pie with veggies and it was not bad.I felt so drained out too once I left from here.Something about this place that just saps out your energy.
298,2,2,If I could give it zero stars I definitely would do it. Today I was outside with my friends and we decided to order the big dinner box. When we started eating the cheese pizza we saw that the cheese pizza had no marinara sauce. It only tasted like cheese and bread. We decided to call the store. The worker left me on hold for about a good 5 mins. Then the manager answered the phone. The manager was extremely disrespectful to me. She then wanted me to go to the store and show her the evidence. Note: I live pretty far from this Pizza Hut. If your going to charge a $4 delivery fee then your customer service should be better.
297,2,2,"Terrible location managed. Pizza comes late and cold. Had to microwave the pizza due to manager only scheduling 1 delivery person on a Friday dinner time for all orders. Corporate needs to fix this location. Also the manager is so rude as I mentioned to her that my pizza is cold, she said, she'll just cancel my order because it'll take over 1 hr to get a new one."
299,2,2,"Asked for a well done pizza, more on the crispy side. What i received was an undercooked/raw dough pizza. I often order from this location and it's pretty good but this time, very unhappy."
300,2,3,"I wish I had looked at yelp before ordering my pizza this evening. I'm traveling from out-of-town and staying at a hotel. You would think a chain would be the same nationwide, but that is not the case. I can't even get through to talk to the manager of this location, so I'm writing a review.First, order was as usual-the online Pizza Hut app is great! Pizza was quick for delivery, which was nice. The reason for the one star is that they didn't call my cell like I indicated in the notes for the order. Instead, I had to get a call from the front hotel lobby that my pizza was downstairs. Then, the driver didn't have any hot dried peppers! What Pizza Hut driver doesn't bring hot peppers with them?  The location knows I'm staying at a hotel and there were no plates, napkins, etc. I still gave a small tip, but not the usual. A quality establishment would answer the phone and offer to bring over some peppers and supplies or a discount. About the pizza, it was hot with all the toppings I requested. It tasted the usual quality Pizza Hut. Summary...If you want a plain Pizza Hut pizza with no extras, this is your place. if you expect anything above the minimum, look elsewhere. I won't be ordering again from this location."
301,2,2,"The absolute WORSE location in my experience. WAITED OVER AN HOUR for pizza that's literally down the street from our home. Maybe we can get past that, but the fact they gave us STALE COLD PIZZA it's beyond UNACCEPTABLE! The fact that they close at 11 we called them since 1020 wouldn't answer waited until 1058 to answer for a young minded young women to answer and say they are closed and HANGUP! It's stupid and childish and for the ratings this location has THEY SHOULD BE CLOSED! Extremely ANNOYED! They don't even deserve a 1 star rating but had to give it to them to post this stupid review. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!"
303,2,2,"Slow and inconsistent service, workers not overly friendly either.  If you order pick-up/take-out or delivery, make sure you INSPECT YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU WALK OUT OR BEFORE DELIVERY PERSON LEAVES.  Sauce was missing from the breadsticks last time I ordered, chicken was short on sauce or had too much sauce, pizza toppings missing, etc.  Pain in the butt."
302,2,2,"Called to order delivery, lady on phone asked if its delivery or pick  up, i said delivery , she says "" she has no driver, i said when will the driver be back , she says i have no idea , seriously lady, why even pick up the phone , you obviously dont care about buisness"
304,2,2,They sure as he11 don't like to answer the phone.  Called 3x during operation hours with no answer.
305,1,1,"Based on the delivery I just had.... Pretty good! Pizza was warm, not hot, but, it IS delivery.  Took 45 minutes, but the guy was super nice, and the food was just what I was craving. I felt the need to post this review because of all of the negative reviews. Maybe my experience is a fluke, or maybe they are better. If I have a bad experience in the future, I'll be sure to update my review!"
306,2,2,The worst customer service ever!!! Website says one thing then they call to say that the offer is no longer valid and charge twice more the original offer. They are always late too.
308,2,2,"I had a similar issue like others have talked about, I ordered a BBQ pizza and it came without BBQ sauce. I called the restaurant and they said there is BBQ sauce on it, believe me, it was not. How rude!!!"
307,2,2,"Tried again and failed again. This place is simply ridiculous. Delivery took 1hr 30mins. When I called to get a status after 1hr 20mins, she rudely told me with an attitude that he left and hung up on me. When the delivery guy finally showed up, I said ""an hour and thirty minutes?!?!"" And he replied ""I know"" and laughed."
309,1,3,I hate that there are no pizza huts that deliver to fairview. We usually have to drive to the north Bergen location to pick up and usually have to wait a while. My pizza is usually cold by the time I eat it. They almost always forget something. If you want the complete polar opposite experience and live in fairview I suggest driving to the  fort lee location. It's a little out of the way but the service is excellent and the pizza even tastes better. Also virtually no wait time.
310,2,2,"This Pizza Hut is the worse, Pizza Hut I have ever been. We ordered buffalo, wings barbecue wings, and garlic Parmesan wings, and it taste like crap and smell like poop. It seems that whoever toss the wings did not wash their hand."
311,2,2,"I ordered pizza pie at 6:05, car was outside at 6:50 by the time I went down to get it the car just left without getting out of the car, called the place said it will be a few more minutes and it's 7:30 already, worse service ever, do not order from here, this is the last time sorry too many other places that wants our business"
312,2,2,Possibly the WORST service in the restaurant business! My boyfriend and I placed a delivery order and after one hour of waiting the lady calls us and tells us that they can't deliver to us. I find that to be unbelievable ! How could it take you one hour to inform a customer that they are out of your range ! Truly RIDICULOUS!  I'd give this place half a star !
313,2,3,It's pizza Hut what can I say lol. Minimal wage workers and cheap food . For last minute it does the trick. Especially after a few drinks. Lol...well now my review says they suck they got my order wrong. What to expect out of minimal wage workers. Then ppl have the nerve to ask for minimal wage to go up.
314,2,2,Ordered twice in the last 2 months.  Both times the orders were wrong. The first time got only 1 order of cheese sticks when 2 were ordered and the pizza had the wrong toppings. Called and the girl who answered was very empathic and seemed sincere in her apology and told me her manager would allow us to get a credit or send it out. Since it was for someone we asked for it to be sent out.Tonight was the second time where bread sticks were wrong. Instead of offering to bring them to me the girl (sounded like the girl from the first incident) said her manager said she'd only give me a credit because the wait time is too long...Looking at the other reviews it seems like it was a mistake to order from this place. Shame.
315,2,2,"DELIVERY -     I hate reading how people whine about the little things, but I guess its all in the little things (DETAIL) that matter.     Monday afternoon, I'm calling around 2:41pm, June 27, 2011.My phone call took FOREVER to answer (I had to call twice). When this woman who barely spoke English answered she literally sighed on the phone before slurring the store name.You would think that would be enough... no, there's more.After waiting on her to have her side conversation, she took my order and the rudest series of""N' thing else""?""N' thing else""?""N' thing else""?""N' thing else""?""N' thing else""?""N' thing else""?I tried to cope because I was direct but not rude.She suggested nothing else on the menu,She act like I was wasting her time,sighing in between ordering other items,When I finally finished, she didn't even say:-THANK YOU-This should take about 00:00 amt. of minutes-Have a good day..................NOTHING!She just hung up the phone."
317,2,2,We just bought some Pizza Hut a bit ago. Ended up throwing the whole order away. It was supposed to be a 2 topping pizza; mushroom and pepperoni. Half of the pizza was practically just cheese with bits of pep and mushroom and the other half was just a pile of pepperoni and mushroom. Wasn't spread out evenly. We ordered 2 different flavor wings. They both looked exactly the same. Just burnt as hell. Couldn't even tell the difference on which was which. The cheese was hard and fell off the crust. So disappointing how bad things still are. I've emailed corporate TWICE and apparently to no avail.
316,3,3,"Pizza was good and fast to our table. No Wi-Fi, but the employee told me I could use the neighboring motel's Wi-Fi. Also no pitchers. Overall not bad. Dark and outdated."
318,2,2,We called to place a delivery order was told no delivery until 5pm we waited and called back and was told no delivery for the day I will NEVER eat at this pizza hut EVER.!!
319,2,2,I went here anlong time ago we waited 30 minutes  to be seated when their was 1 full table we waited almost 1 hour for food the employees were not busy and they did not answer the phone finally the person calling came to the store she had been waiting for 2 hours for her food to be delivered I was not impressed if I was the manager serious changes would me made right away
320,2,2,"We walked in and stood in the front for a bit. The kid behind the counter told us to go find somewhere to sit. Ten minutes later the waitress came over and said she didn't know we sat down............ food was ok took a while to come out. I wanted wings but was told the machine was broken after i had my heart set on them. Super depressing. I had to ask after the third time my waitress came over to refill my drink, which I left right on the edge of the table so she could see. The place was not very clean, and I had to tell the person at the front everything I ordered because he couldn't fine my ticket, and I had to find someone to ask for a box. Over not a good experience."
321,2,2,Hours say 10pm closing.  It's 9:06pm and the woman answering the phone says they are closed ?? For pickup orders too?? Hope the manager knows.
322,1,1,"This is actually one of the best Pizza hut locations in New Jersey. The crust is good, has a nice crispyness to it"
323,2,2,"The employees at this Pizza Hut need major retraining. I placed an online order and went to pick it up. The employees couldn't be bothered to pick up the ringing phones and were more concerned about talking to each other. The customers before me asked for certain dips and sauces in Spanish, to which the employees responded in Spanish and proceeded to give what was requested for free. When my turn came to ask for dips and sauces, I was told I would have to pay. I didn't have time to argue, so I paid $3 for a ranch cup, a blue cheese cup and a cup of marinara for my breadsticks and wings. When I got home, I discovered several issues with my order. My 16 piece wings were supposed to be in Blazin Buffalo sauce, and were ""naked"" boneless wings with a pool of sauce at the bottom of the container. My breadsticks were NOT cut up, so I just had a huge chunk of bread with no score lines to even rip it. The breadsticks had a cup of marinara sauce, which I was not informed of when I was purchasing sauce and dips. The only thing that was good was my personal pan pizza. This was a terrible experience, and I will not return. I do not recommend this Pizza Hut!"
324,2,2,"Horrid. Horrible Pizza Hut, made a complaint to corporate. My wings look like crap, and my pizza had no toppings I paid $40 for a combo and never received my 2 liter soda."
325,1,1,"Got a good coupon from T-Mobile Tuesday, ordered online, it was a nice deal for a large pizza, breadsticks with cinnamon sticks. Lots of franchise places have bad reviews but I'm satisfied with the service. I went there during busy time, staff was friendly, food was ready on time nice and warm. Street metered parking available."
326,2,2,"They cancelled my order because there was a game at the stadium near my apartment. It was already an hour into the game so there was no traffic. I tried to give the hut a chance and they failed miserably. All g, Domino's always delivers."
327,2,2,"I ordered a 2-topping large pizza and 8 pieces of bone-out wings. When I arrived to pick them up, I was given a 1-topping pizza and 6 pieces of bone-in wings. The employee didn't even mention it. When I opened the boxes and found out, the employee mumbled that a refund would be issued. A refund was never issued. I contacted Pizza Hut headquarters. The headquarters said the store would contact me within 3 days. 10 days passed and no one bothered to contact me. I will never order from this store again."
328,2,2,"Terrible customer service! Do not order from here!!!! I placed an order online using a gift card and I paid the remaining balance using my credit card. I was informed upon delivery that they never received payment. I showed the driver my credit card statement with the remaining balance being paid so she decided to call her manager to confirm. Her manager had a nasty attitude and stated I would need to call my bank because the payment I made has nothing to do with them. I am beyond pissed off about this situation as I have now been robbed of my money and to top it all off, the driver took the pizzas back with her. I refused to pay twice because it's just not right! I will never order from this store again and will be telling all of my neighbors to avoid them at all costs. Would give Zero stars if I could."
329,1,3,"I'm not sure what people expect from franchised pizza places, but maybe I've been lucky to have had positive experiences with Pizza Hut. The review is an average of 3 stars for the pizza, it's pretty good but not always amazing. I do love the buttery garlic (or whatever it is) crust though, and this is from an avid crust-hater. I would give 5+ stars alone for the breadsticks honestly. Maybe it's just me! But they're always so hot, fresh and buttery, so give them a try next time. Delivery has always been on time for me (I never ordered late night or busy times/weekends) and staff is friendly. They're one of my favorite go-tos for a good deal when I'm feeling lazy on the weekend."
330,1,2,"Went to order a pizza [physically in the store] around 10pm last Saturday night. Despite nobody but myself being in the store, the associate was busy on the phone for 20 minutes before taking my order, and the wait time was going to be long (45+ mins), so I asked for it to be delivered. Associate said that was fine, so I went on home to wait for the pizza.After an hour and a half had passed, I called the store to see what was up, and the same associate explained that it had never actually been sent out for delivery. I was admittedly pissed, but within 30 minutes a new pizza arrived and so did an apology. AND he gave us another free cheese pizza on top of it! In all, I'm thankful for the associate's attitude; I think the best business practice you can have is to be humble and human and admit when mistakes are made. Good job, Pizza Hut!"
331,2,2,Horrible!!! Our pizza just arrived COLD MUSH!!Never again!!The tv commercials make everything look so good but the real deal is you have to eat it at a Pizza Hut restaurant. Pizza Hut is not made for delivery. We actually threw out the whole pie minus 1 slice! Waste of money.
333,3,3,"I redeemed my T-Mobile Tuesday promotion for a Large 2 Topping Pizza + Free Cinnabon Mini Rolls for $7.99...what a deal man! I created my own pizza with Green Peppers and Italian Sausage. I was thinking about delivery but you need to spend a minimum of $20 so I switched to carry-out. My dad drove me to pick up my order and it wasn't ready yet when I arrived and paid for it. Sadly, the pizza was nothing special...not enough marinara sauce when I peeled back the cheese. The sausage looked so dried. The Cinnabon was yummy but hella sweet not good for my mom whose diabetic. Definitely, I like Papa John's more."
332,1,1,"I'm not going to say that Pizza Hut serves good pizza. It's a chain restaurant, and people from NYC have very high standards especially when it comes to pizza. As such, we are supposed to walk into these chain restaurants with lower expectations. I think this Pizza Hut exceeds expectations, which makes me a fan. I come here every once in a while to redeem my TMobile codes, and I've never been disappointed. One thing that I really appreciate is how accurate their time estimates are. As a resident of NYC, you're likely fast-paced and monochronic as well. This particular Pizza Hut has your order ready when they say it'll be ready. The food: Pizza Hut makes good and consistent chain restaurant food. The thin crust and bone-out wings are crunchy with every single bite. As an experiment, I chewed one bone-out wing 30 times, and lol every bite had crunch. IDK what they put into it, but it's pretty cool. The flavor (garlic parm) is a punch in the mouth, but it's good in moderation. The pizza ingredients taste fresh enough, and that's all I can ask for. I get it, it's cool to trash talk Pizza Hut because it doesn't match your pizza archetype. But you wouldn't expect your 6 year old nephew's crayon painting to be as good as a van Gogh, would you? Adjust accordingly."
334,1,1,"Decided to grab pizza for lunch and ordered the big dinner box online. Did not have any problems with the service; went to pick it up and was already prepared for me to grab and go. I always liked Pizza Hut's food and this meal was no different. The quality is the same as any other branch. This big dinner box was honestly a lot of food for three people; still have so much of the pizzas left. All in all, it was still very filling."
335,3,3,"Stepped up to the counter and made eye contact with someone at the register (manager?) but she was in the process of counting money. She asked me to wait a few minutes, no problem! Then another employee came out and she started questioning her as to why there was money missing from the register. Made things a little awkward. But overall, they had no issues with getting my order correct and done on time. Establishment also looked fairly clean. Food wise, it lived up to its standards of Pizza Hut and I got what I was expecting. Not the greatest pizza but good enough for some cheap fast food. However, the one thing I can't stand when eating out is cheapness from an establishment! I ordered a large pizza, wings, and two pastas but they gave me no napkins or chili flakes or grated cheese. I had to specifically ask for some and all they threw in were 3 packets of cheese.. that was it. Not even napkins! For me, the point of eating out is convenience and would have to give this Pizza Hut a thumbs down for that factor.Parking was horrible! Won't be back."
336,3,3,A very clean establishment but also very small. Just know if you order from here parking is almost non existent. Cashiers are usually not very friendly. Food is also hit or miss. But when done right it is very good. And fortunately for me today I got great service and pizza.
338,1,1,I came here earlier today as I haven't eaten pizza hut in a long time... it was definitely worthwhile as the service was excellent and the food was delicious!!!! Strongly recommend this place!!
337,1,1,"Pretty decent as far as Pizza Hut goes - our pizza was ready on time, made correctly, and was just the right temperature. I didn't think I would be a fan, but the mini Cinnabon were also pretty tasty and the icing melted nicely. While it's not a gourmet pizza place by any stretch, it's a perfectly acceptable place to grab lunch in a pinch for the office or a slow afternoon."
339,2,2,"Beware coming to this location if you do not want to have ecoli.The person who is preparing the food in the back was wearing no gloves and preparing the pizza dough with his bare hands.  In addition, he received a personal phone call on his personal cell phone and then proceed to touch the dough with no gloves nor washed his hands.In addition, this same person is the cashier who handled my money, then went to the back and prepare the food."
340,2,2,"If I could give 0.5 star, I would. My family ordered 3 pizzas online that the confirmation email said would take an hour to be ready.  Instead, I waited for 3 hours and was actually there after the store closed.I got there at my pick up time. There was a crowd of people on one side, but I thought I could quickly show that I had already ordered online and was here for pick-up. Instead, I waited 20 minutes until a customer told me the line WAS for online orders. The line was unrecognizable. It was so disorganized. I waited on this line to give my name and pay and still had to wait again for my food to come out. While I was standing there, I saw other customers come in, give their name, and immediately get their food. I even heard customers call in their orders, saw them come in stating they just called, and walked right out with it. No waiting. This makes NO SENSE!! I received two of my pizzas together and then waited 30 minutes for the final one. Needless to say, my pizza was cold and hard. Why would they come out at such different times? There was clearly no rhyme or reason to the order that the food was made. When I finally got all my food, I was in such a rush to get it home to my family for dinner (at 10:30!) that I didn't check the food only to find out when I got home that the order was wrong. I received two of the same pizzas (the one that was missing was the only vegetarian option), one with an incorrect crust, and 4 cinnamon sticks and 2 cheese sticks (instead of 3 of each). I called back to complain about the missing vegetarian pizza and identified myself as the girl who waited 3 hours. Luckily the guy remembered me and told me to come back tomorrow (since they closed before I left) and he would give me the correct pizza. He's the only reason why I would give even half a star.The poor cashier had to deal with complaining customers who just wanted to know why the food was not coming out in the order that it was placed. As he struggled to explain that he had no clue what was going on either, I saw his supervisor, Sangita, closing the registers for the day behind him ignoring the angry customers. If she wasn't helping the customers directly, why wasn't she helping prepare the food that everyone was waiting for? I just don't understand what was going on back there!"
341,3,1,"I always order online and opt to pick up my order since I don't like paying extra delivery fees. The online estimated times are usually fairly accurate and I've never really had a problem picking up my pizza and side orders. The people are fairly nice, never had a problem at this location. A cheesy crust with roma tomatoes + jalapenos are always gonna be my fav though. :)"
342,1,1,Pizza came out super fresh and hot. No wait time at all because I called it in. I was in out in a matter of 3 minutes. That is perfect for fast food pizza. The only thing is make sure you have someone to sit in the car with you while your running in so you don't get a ticket.
343,2,2,"My parents own factories and have always said that one should ""never sacrifice anything for quality."" Price competition has driven this establishment to the ground. The pizza used to taste significantly better with higher quality ingredients. No more.If you must order from here, make sure you do the online deals (I got two mediums for $8 each). Or at least make sure you have coupons from the weekly local circular. Extra sauce is the only thing that is ""free"". Ask also for paper plates and napkins if you're picking up. This place used to give out free hot pepper packets, too. No longer. The economy will pick up soon and customers will be demanding better ingredients.  This venue is not positioned for a recovery.Don't order delivery. Just. Don't. Carrying out will save you a lot of aggravation. The parking lot is tiny and is shared with a T-Mobile store."
344,2,2,"Legitimately disappointed... wow....unreal i called at 3 for delivery for just a pie and some garlic knots... hour goes by, i called the store they tell me that the delivery driver has a lot of deliveries thats why its taking so long. Okay, understandable- call them again 40 minutes later ask them where my food is- and the guy on the phone said the pizza just left 10 minutes ago. 20 minutes later i'm still sitting here writing this review angry as hell. I LIVE FIVE MINUTES I COULD'VE CRAWLED THERE BACKWARDS AND STILL BEEN THERE FASTER"
345,1,1,Look--it's about the value. My brother-in-law and I shared a Big Dipper. It was huge. We couldn't finish it. But it was delicious. Great concept? Even better taste.
346,1,1,"Decent prices (use their online deals) and efficient online ordering system. I ordered five large pizzas, and the order was ready for pick-up in 20 minutes."
347,2,2,"I dont like how this pizza hut charges for a delivery fee.Medium supreme pizza+breadsticks+coke+garlicsauce= 30.00+tax&tipAre you kidding me? If the pizza and the breadsticks actually tasted good, i wouldnt mind.Never again.Bye forever."
348,2,3,"Predictably bad. One of those things that make you wonder why you ordered from Pizza Hut after you're done eating. They have a pretty good app, but it's the pizza I'm eating, not the technology. Honestly, in-class, Domino's and Papa John's are much better. That said, pizza from these three is always a bad idea."
349,2,2,"The pizza is terrible here (I know it's the same with any other Pizza Huts). Service is very slow.If you want franchise pizza, go with Dominoe's or Papa John's."
350,2,2,"Pizza Hut is Pizza Hut. This particular Pizza Hut is dingy and dark and very dirty. The floor was sticky when I walked in and the service is just not good at all. They are rude and I would never come back here again.  I had to wait 15 minutes for my order of a small personal pie pizza. It is not a comfortable environment and you definitely don't feel safe eating from here. Save yourself, dont come here."
351,2,2,"As an update to my previous review, I stand corrected. This particular Pizza Hut is NOT recommended. This is the LAST time they will ever get my money. Every single time my debit card is declined. Never have a problem with any other place I go to. Only here. You don't want my business? No problem! There's a Domino's just down the street from me who will take my card w/o question. Plus these last 2 times, my pizza wasn't even close to being hot, brought me the wrong drink (again!), and was almost an hour to deliver with an hour left before closing time (I'm less than 10 blocks away!). I'm done with you."
352,2,2,"The manager on Wednesday and Saturday is SUPER CHEAP, I ordered breadstick a few times, and he never even give the marinara sauce.I asked him, where is the sauce that suppose come with the stick. And he goes like saying the sauce doesn't come with it.Then I ask him why does the menu says the breadstick comes with the marinara sauce, then he hesitantly gave the the sauce.I'm mean whats with this guy trying to save a few cent by cheating us out of the sauce.Would someone from pizza hut corporate please fire this AssH@@e.Very pissed long time Cust"
353,2,2,Terrible service. Does not even provide the basic necessities and sauces. Supposedly now breads ticks do not come with sauce
354,2,2,"This pizza hut location sucks. Don't buy from here. Delivery takes about an hour. I asked for cups when I ordered, and the delivery man does not have any idea what I am talking about. I always give $5, tip in addition to their service charge of $2.50, and their service never improved. I regret of giving them tips, and I regret that I ordered from them, because they are near to my house. Papa John's tastes better, but there is none nearer to me. From now on, I will try to avoid to order from them. I definitely not patronize them, aside from their not good pizza, service is very slow, and does not even give you what you want. DONT ORDER OR BUY FROM THIS PIZZA HUT. LEARN FROM US!"
355,2,2,"I order a pizza here many times and there was one time the delivery guy didn't have the customer receipt for me to sign so he just gave me the sales copy instead. A month later I see on my credit card bill that Pizza Hut was charging me over $3.00 for tip!! Luckily, my credit card company took care of it. This place has been declining and what can say happened today just broke the horses back of me ever ordering here again. I ordered a delivery at 6:35 PM and usually as they said in past deliveries should take about 30-40 minutes for a pizza arrived. My order arrived 16 minutes late and was cold! The service here is incredibly slow. This is the second time this has happened. The receipt today prints to instruct the delivery guy to Deliverer by 7:15 PM"" and it arrived at 7:31PM and cold. Wanting a hot pizza and saying it would take only 30 minutes I opted for the another pizza instead of $5.00 credit. When it arrived the delivery guy had me give him back the other pizza! You would think with the raised ""$2.00 Delivery Charge"" and the tip I just gave before I should had had that other pizza. I was better off just taking out a frozen supermarket pizza from the refrigerator and microwaving it instead."
356,1,1,During quarantine// this location has been my go-to!! There is a delivery gal (wish I could remember her name) but she is absolutely the kindest soul! I was struggling with my 2 year old and puppy when she delivered my loaded order and she still was patient and so genuinely sweet!! It really is wonderful to see people out there with such beautiful attitudes!!
357,1,1,Always my favorite . The veggie lovers pizza and mixed two medium for 6$ is so clutch! They are very fast and it's delicious every time. I really like this location for pick up too. Will be back!
358,3,2,I ordered a Detroit Style Pizza on Saturday 2/6 we didn't care for it at all. I've always got my pizza from this location never any complaints but this time it was not good. We both got sick.
359,2,2,We ordered curbside and we called when we got there sitting there watching the employees staring at the phone  and our pizza was completely burnt!
360,1,1,AJ! She is awesome! Best experience I've ever had at any Pizza Hut vegas wide!  She literally helped me with no problem! I will never go to a different location due to her she handled any questions I had and was more then polite sweet and friendly thank you so much AJ she is the best !!
361,2,2,"Assistant manager Ressa has a very nonchalant attitude and the staff at this location STEALS. picked up a pizza and dropped my wallet in the process .. when returned back to me it was completely empty . Manager said my wallet never left the counter , yet she's refusing to review the camera footage. It almost makes me believe she took it."
362,2,2,Who In They Right Mind Bring A Pizza And Serve It  From The Ground Do You Know How Unsanitary That Is In This Life Of Time Then Tell Me They Just Doing They Job Really Look I Deserve Another Pizza I Feel I Do Due To That Customer Service Are You Serious?!!!I Need Another Pizza Not From The Ground Due To That I've Thrown It Away Proceed To Eating And Feeding My Family Ramen Noodles Instead WTF I'm Out My Money And A Promise To My Family!!!!!!!!
363,2,3,"Burnt breadsticks and pizza.  Make sure to check your food before leaving.  Also, PH started charging for pepper flakes and grated  cheese."
364,1,1,"It's so convenient to our home, it's so close! We've had takeout a few times from this location and the pizza has been very good- perfect, no black burns on the cheese, not soggy, toppings were good. The online special is hard to beat. We go back and forth between this one & Domino's (takeout specials; sometimes we get Little Caesar's) except this one is way closer to us. The orders are always correct.  I like hand tossed. I like thin. (It's not that I dislike thick crust, it's just I can only handle one slice because it is so heavy.) Compared to Domino's this pizza has more grease, but I just soak it up with a napkin. The slices are about half and half, some are large, while others are small. The first time we visited (last year), there was a problem with our gift card, so the manager gave it to us for free. Didn't have to do that, but we appreciated it, so I am mentioning it here."
365,1,1,Christina is amazing! Always great attitude and is very sweet! She's my favorite ! Very efficient and always remembers what we like and never a missing item!
366,2,2,"Absolutely terrible service . I ordered take out and the driver forgot half the order he told me he would be right back after 30 minutes I cancelled the rest of the order.  Just terrible service , after I called talked to the manager and they did nothing to make it right No wonder there stock is crashing I would not recommend this type of service in today's world good luck pizza hut I will never go back"
367,2,2,"Honestly ... I have not been satisfied with this Pizza Hut. For 3 times in a roll.. I have been so unhappy. I don't think I will be ordering from this Pizza Hut any more. Today I ordered a customized pan size pizza, wings, & fries. When I opened the box of the pizza it was so messy and it looked so unappetizing. I felt like the sauce was just too much. I don't understand how you can serve someone that. The wings were okay. But the Cajun cries I ordered.. For $2 there not a lot .. The quantity for was very disappointing too. This isn't the first time that I've been unhappy with this location. Other times they forgot my topping! Keep it mind of course I did pay extra for my toppings. And another time the pizza was extremely salty ... At this point I rather choose Dominos."
368,2,2,"I ordered 2 pizzas and garlic knots take out and my pizza was over cooked, I was so disappointed. Only half of it was actually cheesy and the rest had to go in the trash because it was so dried up."
369,2,2,I ordered the pizza with bbq sauce instead of the regular. Tell me why I get a pizza with the sauce on the side and the pizza was completely dry. Also the guy that delivered even tried coming in my house and asked if he can smoke weed. Foreal this is the 3rd time this has happened. Thank god I moved!
370,2,2,"My personal experience with this location last time. Phone wait time 20 minutes. Where I was told your order should be ready within 20-25 minutes,Arrived at the store to pick up my order after 20 min where on the order status is written my order was ready 4 minutes prior my arrival (awesome right) yeah you would think so,Cashier- sir I do apologize for the inconvenience and for the wait time if you would like I can give you a free soda with your order.  Your order is not ready yet, it should be ready in about 15 to 20 min, well I guess I'll wait right. Total wait time amount 65 minutes. Cashier goes back and get my order ready without even washing her hands , are you serious!!Then accidentally she drops something on the floor and without hesitation she grabs it and grabs my pizza with it. This is just ridiculous, When I asked her if she washed her hands and regarding dirty dish she denied it.Places like this need to be shut down and not serve to public, I had other experiences with other location pizza hot but nothing like this.  Also cleanliness is disgusting, food all over the floor, see pics"
371,2,2,Bro how are you gonna fill the sauce up LESS than half way ??????? On some crack fr fr
372,2,3,Delivery usually doesn't take too long. I order from this location from home and from work. My only complaint is that THEY ALWAYS FORGET THE FLAVOR ON THE CRUSTLike come on.... every time? So annoying
373,2,2,"Ordered for delivery and at the time I was supposed to receive my food they call and say the driver started to leave but had car troubles? So they tell me that they'll send another driver and my food has been sitting there for at least an hour and a half and I want to cancel and they don't offer to make me a new pizza after the first call about the broken car. Apparently couldn't cancel and they sent their driver all the way here for me to refuse the food. It was just a mess, won't order here again."
374,2,2,"Ordered pizza for delivery, 40 min goes by and get a call from an employee saying our drivers car broke and we had to wait for another driver. Which okay I understand but then you leave my pizza sitting around for another hour instead offering a fresh pizza. Unprofessional and bad customer service. Then we called to cancel for how long it was taking and told us we couldn't cancel a cash order. So I sent the driver away with my hour old pizza and again no offer of an actual fresh one like we were going to pay for. The management and employees need some training on how to deal with situations like this. I was not rude or anything either."
375,2,2,"These guys have the worst customer service. The ""customer service manager"" was rude and practically called me a liar saying they don't offer these codes when it was emailed to me from Pizza Hut, then I read her the email and she said oh""you must have to order online"" which I had, that's why I was calling because i was ordering online and did enter my code yet at check out, even though it said Free Large Pizza, it was charging me hence why I called the store. Useless employees make your business awful. I feel bad as I generally like ordering from here and PS I was still paying for the rest of our order it's not like I was just ordering the free large. After not getting my issue resolved I asked that they cancel my order then received notice that all codes had been redeemed and could no longer be used so I got doubly screwed. Oh well. Their loss. I'm an easy going customer who ordered at least two to three tones a month and a great tipper. No more. I'll take my business elsewhere where they don't call you a liar and they honor their deals and actually try to resolve customer issues instead of escalating them. I can now see why they have such a poor rating. ‍"
376,2,2,"I haven't had pizza hut in years and will most likely never eat it again after the horrible service and the complete lack of competence from their employees. I waited at the counter for about 10 minutes before I received any service. Not only did they make my first pizza incorrectly, they made my SECOND pizza incorrectly. As I was waiting for my pizza to be remade-after already driving home with it and having to come back, I arrive to their location over hearing someone calling to complain about their incorrect delivery order. Not to mention they proudly hang a ""B"" from the health department on their wall, anyone who has worked in a kitchen knows that this is nothing to be proud of. Way to go pizza hut Durango, you're a bunch of winners."
377,3,1,The Pizza is pretty good in comparison to other fast food pizza places. The girl that answers was very nice. She deserves five stars.
378,1,1,"Called to see what the specials were and left a pick up order. Was told about 15 minutes. Once there, realized that this place is for pick up or delivery only. They person at the counter was really friendly and my pies were ready. Pretty inexpensive at only $14.00 for 2 pizzas loaded with toppings. Great deal after moving from California where one pizza is easily $ 25.00.Pretty good pizza too. Give it a try if close by."
379,1,1,On of the best customer service you will recieve! Kenny has the most upbeat personality!!!!! Do a survey & get a free breadstick.
381,1,3,"Ok, so i dont usually pick up, I usually have it delivered and these people are just awesome. My pizza always is so good  It looks amazing and tastes even better, not going to lie, I probably shouldn't be here as much as I do but whatever. It's cheat day"
380,2,3,"Two stars because at least they try to fix their mistakes. Pizza is good when it's good and wings are usually cooked very well. The box deal is a good deal if you're looking for a mix of foods. As for my experience wasn't great. They messed up one of the pizzas but they did fix the order and allowed us to take the messed up pizza home. This location does mess up a lot. At the end of our visit the cashier was out of pennies so she asked ""is it okay if I short you a penny"". I thought to myself she couldn't be serious."
382,2,2,"**LAME CUSTOMER SERVICE**So I just got off the phone with this location about my online order and them not being able to fill my order because they were all ""Out"" of the personal pan pizza dough/crust. In actuality it was because this was a promotion of 50% off regular priced pizza ordered online which brought my regular order of 3 pizzas to $9.34 after tax and delivery. Now since they were ""Out"" of this dough/crust they could change the dough/crust in the system and it would only change to $25.64 before delivery and taxes. So instead of making things right and offering to give me my order at the discounted price with the other crust I was told all they could do was change the crust in the computer, but I would have to pay the difference. My question is how in the heck does a pizza location go out of its most popular dough knowing they have this promotion? Answer: They don't. They just try to bully you into paying more for a ""different"" crust. How do I know..I just called them again to place an order over the phone for the same thing and it wasn't a problem because they could charge me regular price since it wasn't an online special promotion. Funny how the dough/crust is now available."
383,2,2,"I eat a lot of pizzas in my life, and of course I eatbad pizzas also but a bad pizza like This is my first time !!The pizza was as sweet as a horrible apple pie, you'll be ashamed of you pizza hot I'm not going to eat any more with you!!in one word is horrible"
384,3,3,My go to location when in need since it's down the block. Only thing that's holding  me back from more stars is that my order isnt made correct sometimes. Other than that I have no problems. ^_^
385,1,1,This Pizza Hut is consistent and good! Fast delivery and always comes hot and fresh! Thank you guys!
281,2,2,"I asked for a bag and the indian/middle eastern dude at the cashier counter throws me a tiny bag and is like ""idk if this will fit but u can try"" and then turns and walks away. Also they charge u really expensive prices and they are also inconsistent with their menu prices. Some days it's $17 for a large pepperoni, other days it can be $20. Who knows. Never coming back here lol."
387,2,2,One of the worst customer service experiences ever. I called to check the status of my delivery order since it was getting over the hour mark to find my order was lost and the attitude of the person on the phone for their mistake was atrocious. Tried speaking to the manager and was left one hold for 5 minutes and just gave up. Contacted customer service.
388,3,1,The pizza is better than I expected and the specials are very good. You get a good pizza and a very good price. On the weekends to get a little backed up and you might have to wait an extra 15 to 20 minutes.
389,2,2,"Update...Still haven't received my refund, so basically they stole my money and lied to me that I'd get it in 10 business days...and it's been way longer than 10 business days. I'm not surprised but I was still hopeful I would get my money back for such poor delivery service, especially since the owner reached out to me on Yelp. I will never go back to this Pizza hut."
390,2,2,So its be been 1 hour and 5 min. Still haven't got my order and I only live 3.1 miles away from there location .   I called in twice for my order both time they said the guy is around the corner he is gonna be there soon.Hey location manager u r representing a big company get on to it.  Look at ur review hire some good driver or if u can't make  delivery and make pizza in 55 min.  Sell your company to dominos  even if they r 4.5 miles away they deliver before 45 min Worse ever super mad
391,2,2,"Night manager is creepy and rude. Not worth ordering here. Do not recommend this place. I give him the one finger up, hah and it's not my thumb!"
392,2,2,"Early in the afternoon I'd ordered 2 pizzas to be delivered .3 miles away at 6:30 - we didn't want to leave the gathering to pick up.  I called at 5:30 to ask for it at 7 since one of our party had to be at physical therapy late.  At first they refused - then took my CC again and said 'will do'.  When the pizza was delivered a little after 7 - which was fine - the pizza was pretty cold and we had no way to reheat - we're thinking it would have tasted better if hot - seems like they still cooked for 6:30 and let sit until delivery at 7 - yup, seems that way...We'll choose someone else another time..."
393,2,2,"Placed an order today, and the email said that it would take 39 minutes. An hour later, the delivery still wasn't here, so I called the shop just to see what was going on. The first thing that the young lady said to me when I told her that I was checking on it was ""oh my god"". She made it seem like I was a burden on her. She then said that they were just busy and to call back if I wasn't happy with the order. When the delivery guy showed up about 15 mins after that, I told him that he needs to tell his manager that he shouldn't have people talking to customers like that. He kept apologizing and saying that she was 17 and it was her first job. Common sense would tell anyone not to say ""oh my god"" to customers. I will never deal with this place again. Food was cold by the time it got here too."
394,1,1,"Very pleased with the quick delivery. Always on time or arrives earlier than promised. Pizza is great and desserts are really good. I always order here whenever I want a quick dinner. No hassles, fast, easy and delicious."
396,3,3,"This location is take-out only. The service is what you expect from Pizza Hut at this type of place and that is ""good"".Parking is adequate it is easy to pop in, get your order and then leave. Because I order pizza well-done it almost always takes longer for them to get my order ready than the estimate given on-line. I have only ordered from this location on-line."
395,2,1,"I've haven't felt this finessed since I lost all my money in a Ponzi scheme. I paid 30 dollars for some room temperature ""hand tossed"" pizzas that were basically thin crust and a very mushy brownie that just fell apart that I had to wait for since they thought my name was something else yet they didn't bother to call it out since it is on the screen. I have worked at both dominos and Pizza Hut and I recommend you go to dominos every time. Ken, if you are reading this I would highly suggest you check in on your stores more often I'm sure you would be stunned at what you see."
397,2,2,I want to throw up when I think about what happened to me from this Pizza Hut. I ordered 2 med pizzas a cookie and hot wings. The pizzas were very mediocre lacking toppings and cheese mainly dough. Pizza Hut has always been amazing! But this location is absolutely disgusting and the pizzas don't even taste like Pizza Hut  pizzas. But the worst thing was the CHICKEN WINGS! Pizza Hut chicken wings have always been the best chicken wings ever. but again not at this horrible location. I looked at the wings (thankfully) before I ate them and they were full of FEATHERS! never in my life! Have I seen chicken wings that still had many many! Feathers on them. It was definitely the most disgusting experience I have ever had with Pizza Hut and it also ruined my desire to eat chicken wings. I'm starting to really give up on fast food. Cant go wrong with a good home cooked meal. At least you don't have to worry about eating Buffalo feathers
398,2,2,"My wife ordered a pizza 11/19 at 7:02 P.M. Had a pick up time of 7:20 . I arrived at 7:25 and was not ready . I was told another 5 minutes which turned into another 15 minutes .After waiting an extra 20 minutes for our order I asked for two dipping sauces , they proceeded to charge me approx. $1.20 for the sauce. I feel for our wait they could have gave us those and a discount but nada.Not the best customer service."
399,2,2,"Order 2 large pizzas with an hour and a half in advance for our lunch break at work, and specified that we needed them by 11:30 a.m. due to us only taking half an hour lunch, pizzas did not arrive until a few minutes before noon, our lunch break was almost over not only did they arrive extremely late, but the pizzas were medium instead of large. The driver was in such a hurry when he arrived, horrible service....."
400,2,2,"I really wish you could give 1/2 stars or no stars on yelp. WORST pizza I have ever had in my life. Hey and that's saying a lot where I am concerned. Our company had a variety of 10 different kind of pizzas delivered for lunch today. I tried the Hawaiian, pepperoni, and meat pizzas.The quality was poor, the crust was like cardboard, and they skimped on the toppings. I actually didn't even finish a whole slice, when I got to the edge of the crust I just could not eat it. There was barely enough cheese on the pepperoni slice to cover the sauce. I have had good pizza from pizza hut before, but avoid this location if your life depends on it."
401,2,2,"Probably the worst pizza experience of my life. I ordered two pizzas online. I usually have no problem ordering online but this was just ridiculous. My ready to pick up time was suppose to be 7:12pm. I ended up getting to Pizza Hut to pick it up around 7:20 and it wasn't ready. So I waited and when they showed me, one of my pizzas had the wrong toppings. The first girl who helped was very nice about it but still I was pretty annoyed that i waited longer than I should have. Girl#1 tells girl#2 that they made the wrong pizza and girl#2 says well what does she want us to do? And girl#1 says she wants us to make her the correct pizza (girl#1 is way nicer by the way). So they keep going back and forth and girl#2 is just not understanding that I just want another pizza to replace the one they messed up. I'm very annoyed at this point because i shouldn't have had to wait this long in the first place, so I go up to girl#2 and tell her I just want what I ordered and then she tells me I'm going to have to pay for another pizza. I'm very irritated and confused at this point. I ask her why I have to pay for another pizza if they are the ones who did not get my order correctly in the first place. We go back and forth for a few minutes and I just tell her what I wanted on my new pizza and she says that they're just going to make me another one. At this point I'm over it. I just want my pizzas and to go home. And after I walk away girl#2 asks girl#1 which pizza I wanted!!!! So I am livid at this point and I walk back up to the counter and tell the girl what kind of pizza I wanted. I had to show her on my phone what I had ordered even though she was holding the receipt in her hand and I had to remind her of the wings I ordered also. When I finally ended up getting both pizzas, the first one was already cold. There was a lot of people complaining about how their orders were not ready on time also. Most likely won't return to this Pizza Hut location anymore."
402,2,2,"I ordered pizza for pickup, once I arrived home I realized there was hair in my food. I simply called back to this location and asked for a remake and for them to deliver it to me. I didn't think this was to much to ask considering it wasn't my fault. I was told that's wasn't an option (all while being super rude) and when I asked to speak with the manager was told there wasn't one even tho when I picked up my pizza I clearly saw a man with a solid red polo shirt on which was different from the rest. They need to work on customer service."
403,2,2,"I am normally a very accepting person. If mistakes are made, I will over look them. But this was unacceptable. I ordered a large pizza, a pasta, breadsticks and a root beer. What I got, over an hour and a half later, was the wrong pizza, bone cold pasta, breadsticks without sauce, and a Pepsi , which is just motor oil with sugar, ( the driver said they were out of my soda, but they could have atleast called and asked what I wanted instead of root beer), dropped off by an incredibly rude driver. The fact that they tried to charge me for this I take as an insult. I will never be using this Pizza Hut again, Pizza Hut in general is questionable. For those of you who care about food, I would recommend AGAINST this establishment. For somebody who normally smiles at others mistakes, this was unbelievable. At least the manager had the common sense to give me back my money. Besides that small bit of decency, I would have given this place a zero or negative one, if that were even possible. I've learned my lesson, I hope you can learn from me."
404,2,2,"It's no doubt your ratings are so low.  I was picking my husband up from work (in a gated residential community) Thursday night 6/13 when a silver jeep commando (with the Pizza Hut hat on its roof displaying the telephone number of (702) 253-9011) sped by me.  As we were driving out of the gates, the same silver jeep commando was riding our butt and then started beeping his horn at us WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THE GATE TO OPEN!  I then called the 253-9011 number, was given the run around by the telephone answerer, I asked for a supervisor who advised their store does not deliver to 7885 W. Flamingo, he offered the telephone number of the store that would deliver to that address.  I dialed the number and got a recording that said they were closed.  I then called several other pizza hut stores asking if they delivered to 7885 W Flamingo, they all pointed me to the store I originally called.  I hope this review gets to a person with integrity & authority so action might be taken to avoid unsafe, impatient drivers possibly taking a life."
405,2,2,"Worst pizza experience yet. I ordered by phone, gave CC info and got total. After 1 hour and 20 min I call to see where my delivery order was...they said they don't have an order...so i reorder w the manager Robert Harrison, who offered no consolation, and drove to the location. After all that, I waited another 20 minutes in the store to get my pizza. I'll be ordering pizza from somewhere else for now on."
406,1,3,"I absolutely love the Pizza Hut wings in the buffalo hot flavor. I always loved their wing sauce, but a few years back their wings sucked! You could tell they were frozen wings and not fresh, you know the kind with all the brown yuk all over them, but eventually they upgraded them to larger and fresher wings, and I've been hooked ever since. With the upgraded wings came an upgraded price. Now the wings are $1 per wing plus tax, no combos included so it's definitely steep for fast food. With that said I sit back and wait for wing Wednesday or coupons sent to my email. I just can't fathom spending full menu price here anymore, but luckily they email me at least one decent coupon a week. I'm also grateful for how many locations they have. I'm right in the middle of three of them nearby. Unfortunately I can no longer order from the Pizza Hut that actually delivers to my house. They just so happen to hire my husband of 7 years' ex girlfriend, who still tries for my man, so I can't risk her tampering with my food. I actually answered the door and saw her when I ordered my last delivery lol.Oh and this Cheyenne location recently double charged my credit card for a carry out order, and when I called the next day to have a refund or a credit, the manager was off and the assistant manager actually told me to dispute the transaction with my bank! He said he wouldn't be able to help me, which of course upset me. However, two days later the the transaction was finally refunded automatically without a call back."
407,1,1,"The manager at this location legit in the back dishing out pizzas like he was pulling them straight from the commercial. I don't know about everyone else's experiences but every time I come here and the manager Dalton is there, this dude serving up a customer experience level over 9000. The rest of the team are cool too don't get me wrong but Dalton just stands out wether he's in the back making pizzas or in the front ringing people up. Always has a great attitude and is really polite. If there's someone who gives a fuck about people/customers is this guy right here, and that's what it's all about. Keep doing what you do man. Killing it!"
408,2,2,"If you enjoy waiting an hour and a half for delivery, rude employees who hangs up on people, and a manager who doesn't know the first thing about customer service then this is your place. Placed an order only to find out it'll be nearly two hours before they can deliver due to only one driver on duty. Asked for a refund only to be told it'll be a week until it's returned into my account. Horrible customer service here. Highly recommend another Pizza Hut where they know what they're doing"
409,1,3,"I'm giving them 5 stars because of customer service. Haven't received pizza yet, but employee was awesome on the phone.. the other pizza places their customer service suck.."
410,2,2,"How is this place still open with all these bad reviews??? My husband just placed an order to pick up. We ordered a large cheese and a large pepperoni. When he picked it up, they gave him both pepperoni. He explained what he ordered. They didn't order money back on the pizza they messed up. They said ""oh sorry, we can make you another cheese but it's going to take 30 mins"" so he ended up coming home AND PAYING FOR a pizza that won't be eaten. I will never again come here."
411,1,1,"This is my Pizza Hut, there are many like it but this one is mine! Just wanted to post that I ordered another Pizza and again had a great experience from Dalton! This guy's customer service is on point, if everyone had customer service skills like this guy there would never be a confrontation of any sort.. He deserves to be given a great review, employee of the month, and employee of the year!I hope they give him some type of commendation!"
412,2,2,"This place has an awful lack of customer service, starting from the GM Kylie, when she's there the phone is never answered and always have to go online or come in to order, secondly Kylie the GM is rude and condescending, I asked to speak with a manager because of how rude she is and her response was "" Hi I'm Kylie the manager"" if this is the standard for hospitality at this establishment, it won't be in business long. Can Papa johns put a location in this shopping center because this Pizza Hut is Trash, and employs rude people all the way to management."
413,2,2,Terrible service.  Ordered and never arrived. I called and they said on the way. Still waited and still never arrived.
414,3,2,Placed an order for delivery. Upon delivery it is missing half my breadsticks!!! Tried calling them and they won't  answer the phone!!***UPDATE*** Called another Pizza Hut location that contacted the manager through back channels. They delivered my missing breadsticks.
415,2,2,"Ordered carry out. Showed up 5 minutes after the time it said it would be ready. Inside the store our order was marked as ""ready"" to falsify their stats to corporate. Wasn't ready. Was told it would be another 45 minutes. Decided to come home and change the order to delivery. Tried calling, 15 minutes no response phone disconnected. Called back, waited 10 minutes, heard background noise when the phone was picked up, hung up on. Drove back to the store and explained the order was placed 2 hours ago, wasn't able to call in to change to delivery (was going to request delivery charge be waived but we would still tip the driver). Told the manager we understand sometimes it gets busy, but at this point 2 hours later and 2 visits to the store what could be done in terms of compensation. Free breadsticks... Manager explained internet orders get bottom priority. OK... that's helpful. Told the manager he can keep the food. Ordered Marcos, far superior. For an extra $1 I'll stick with them from now on. Franchise owner of this Pizza Hut doesn't give a shit about his stores either (looked him up, all of his stores have shit reviews). They need management that doesn't falsify their stats and actually staffs properly with a crew that knows what they're doing. Used to be a regular customer but after several nights of them getting backed up like this I knew it wasn't just a 1 night fluke. Shame really but what do you expect from a lazy franchise owner."
416,1,1,"I have no idea why this location doesn't have 5 stars! I order delivery from here often they are always on time and always get my order exactly correct even with my milk allergies. The delivery is always under 30 minutes wait time and the delivery guy is always friendly. Pizza is hot and wings are ""burnin"". I definitely recommended this location. They rock. Now I want pizza!!!"
417,2,2,"One word"" horrible service"" I call for delivery service I understand someone ahead of me but not picking up the phone for almost 30 minutes not right at all and I try to  call back again still no one is answering the phone. I end up driving all the way just to order a Pizza. Please leave your job If you don't like it anymore!!!! Thanks"
418,2,2,"I ordered Pizza Hut when a visiting friend friend mentioned it as a preference. I tried the pizza, wings, potato fries and brownie desert.Each of the entrées was extremely salty and the desert was sub par to say the least. I did not care for the taste of any. I will happily continue to order Dominos."
419,2,2,"They messed up the first pizza, no cheese on one side  (how that happens is beyond me). So we waited for a replacement which was even worse,  barely any sauce and less cheese than the first one.  They did give us both pizzas for the price of one else, but it should have been free."
420,1,1,"Brand New location. I was so excited when I saw that one was opening and I was not unimpressed. We've had a few deliveries to our house already with no mistakes. All the delivery people have been extremely nice and didn't freak out when our fur babies were barking like savage beasts. Our orders were complete with no mistakes and arrived within the time frame they gave, if not earlier. Pizza Hut has so many options now from the different sauces, crusts and toppings. They always have some kind of deals going on, which is awesome. I can stuff myself with a pizza I like and Mike can stuff himself with a pizza he likes. It's a Pizza Hut so don't expect it to be a gourmet authentic Italian pizza. Like I said earlier, prompt and friendly delivery with no mistakes. Can't beat that from a Pizza Hut."
421,2,2,I have had to call several times and have talked to JAY about the drivers they have speeding in MY neighborhood.. I will never order from this location again it just doesn't seem like they care
422,1,1,"Everybody knows Pizza Hut. Either you like Pizza Hut or you don't. This new location makes the same pizza as the old location, off of Cheyenne & Buffalo, but I think every Pizza Hut makes the same pizza. As this new location is less than 5 minutes away from my house, I have been going here a LOT. I always order online, to get the best deals & they have always gotten my order right. For the price, Pizza Hut Pan Pizzas are the best pizzas in my area. Rosati's down the street is better, but they are twice the price & they have gotten my order wrong a few times. On this location's service, I have only been treated very good here, with no complaints on their service. I have never used their Delivery Service, so I can't comment on that. On delivery drivers speeding, I have not seen it. Although I, myself drive 10 MPH over the speed limit, so they maybe they are speeding in the legal sense of the what is speeding. With the sheer number of times that I have ordered their pizza, it can't be luck that I have never had a issue with this location. I really don't understand their bad reviews or low rating. I guess Haters gonna hate, hate, hate?"
424,2,2,"They delivered my food cold, 30 mins after the  driver Logan had dispatched from the store 3 mins away, according to manager Christian. I live on shady timber, right behind the Walmart/pizza hut and Christian the manager on duty informed me he would not tell the drivers where to go first."
423,1,1,"We have had pizza delivered every Friday night for 2 years for us, our kids still at home and our grandkids. Never had one problem with them or the food that was delivered. They will periodically give us free items and will call us if they are out of something we order, since we use the Pizza Hut app. Delivery Team is always friendly and speaks to our kids and our dog Molly. The Presley's"
425,3,2,"It's not the Pizza Hut  from when I grew up. Hardly any cheese, dough is not buttery and fluffy like it used to be, toppings are sparse.  And they take an hour to deliver when I literally live 1.5 miles away. Overall a big disappointment."
426,2,3,2 Thumbs Down! I always do Online ordering from other pizza places and never had a bad experience till now. They never got my pizza order right and on top of that i wasn't the only one they messed up other people before me that was picking there pizza up there orders were messed up too. All i can say is stay away from this place because obviously making pizza is Rocket Science and there not qualified! #smdh#fail#booo
427,2,2,Called I an order 20 minutes be ready.  Customers before ordered over the phone as well and are still waiting. They don't know what there doing here so unorganized and poorly trained. No manager on duty! Taking my business elsewhere next time!
428,2,2,Really slow service.  Delivery and pick up.  My pizza looked like the workers cut out pieces for lunch and just lined it back up so it wasn't noticable.
429,1,1,Great service! Austin is a Rockstar. He took care of my order. I called as I was driving to pick it up. It was ready about 5 minutes after I got there. It was perfect just like I ordered!! Thx
430,2,2,"The last two times I've ordered from this location, I've ordered cheese sticks and pizza. Instead of cheese sticks, they've given me breadsticks each time. The first time, didn't really pay attention as I was in a rush and only noticed when I got home. However, the second time, when the guy opened the box to show me what I had ordered, as I was paying, I noticed the difference right away and actually asked him if those were indeed cheese sticks in the box because there was no cheese anywhere and the whole thing looked extremely dry. He lied and said 'they are cheese sticks, like you asked for'. But I was far from convinced. So, I decided to try another Pizza Hut location a few days later and at that location, the cheese sticks were definitely cheese sticks. These cheese sticks also looked identical to the ones in the pics on the Pizza Hut website. So, the guys at the Cheyenne Ave location are basically lying to some of their paying customers and not giving us what we ordered and paid for. Their pizzas are also often dry and have hardly any sauce on them. I was going to this location because it's very close to where I live, however, I'd rather drive a few extra miles and get better pizza and honest employees."
431,2,2,"I don't understand why there's good reviews about this place! The customer service is horrible!! Tonight I ordered online carry out and when I got there no greeting at all what so ever and there was several people behind me. Come on people!! It's not like that location is big and you can't see us walking through the door!! I remember the manager he was prepping food and he told one of his associate frank to get the orders. I told frank my name and it said it was ready on the screen, then he was looking for my order and the manager yelled out to him "" ITS NOT READY!! ITS NOT READY?!! DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ME DOES IT LOOK LIKE IM CHINESE!"" And as an CHINESE CUSTOMER you might want to shut your mouth about making those comments!! I know he wouldn't of stop but his associate said something and I saw him glare up at me and just brushed it off like it was nothing!! This is NOT how customers want to be treated!! I will be contacting corporate because we don't need another racist severing us food!!"
432,2,2,"I love Pizza Hut. I ordered a pizza and some wings around 1:30 pm, thinking it would be a nice treat on my birthday. Not at all. I waited an hour and a half for my pizza to arrive, but I figured, it's Saturday, maybe they're really busy. When the pizza finally arrived around 3 pm I opened the door to a not so friendly delivery driver. Once I open my pizza I immediately know it's old. The cheese was literally brown and the pizza was not warm at all. I called to let the manager know I would be bringing it back and expecting a full refund. He was actually really nice and understanding. Unfortunately, I had to start getting ready for work and ended up not having time to take it back. Total waste of money, the full pizza went to waste which is rare in my house. Won't be going back to this location and since this is the second time I've received an old, cold pizza from a Pizza Hut I may just find another pizza place period."
433,1,1,I've consistently gotten great delivery service  and pizza from this Pizza Hut for over 3 years now.  The only issue II've had was out of their control and due to their phone lines being down for a short period of time - which had happened with all Pizza Huts in the service area at that time. Always good pizza - zero complaints!
434,1,1,"From a somewhat frequenter of delivery from this location, we absolutely give a solid 4 stars overall (MANY orders' worth over the years!).Funny, I went to merely ""check in"" to learn I haven't reviewed this Pizza Hut yet! Also given this, I'm bummed I didn't snap pics because our orders were Snapchat worthy tonight (alas, too late)!LOVE the specials. LOVE (& appreciate) the rewards points (tonight's order included a free large ""anything you want on it"" pizza).Decent quality. If you've read my other reviews of local pizzas, I've been kinda embarrassed to mention that Pizza Hut's has been better than those at specialty places. I'd be flogged by some for lauding Pizza Hut, but with a consistently happy family fed at a reasonable cost, I'm delighted to give them our support/endorsement!FYI, frequent problems with their mobile app: Absolutely recommend the desktop version especially if you have coupons, rewards points, or a special order (tonight was no exception).Delivery tonight was INSANELY FAST! Granted we live less than a mile away, but dang if I wasn't about to take a shower when the doorbell rang!About their wings (I'm a big wing fan & from near Buffalo, NY): If you like boneless, cool, go for it. Generally there's plenty of sauce, but you may need to toss the container to coat them more thoroughly. I personally prefer ""real"" bone-in wings (but since I'm a minority in my family, I rarely win - but tonight I ""won""). Ordered Buffalo medium: A) They were more mild vs medium, B) They needed MORE sauce (um, boneless versions almost had too much, so don't know what's up here). But, the bone-in wings were of a decent size and interestingly more positively memorable than our order from Buffalo Wild Wings (& less expensive to boot!), and C) Didn't think about but wondering now: celery or Bleu cheese? Dunno! If I ordered ""hot,"" I absolutely would've wanted them, but given so little sauce and heat with the ""medium,"" they didn't cross my mind.Pizzas ordered: both larges with marinara sauce and ""Hut Favorite"" crust sprinkle:1. Thin crust, with pepperoni & sausage. A common order, however both eaters commented on why we often accept the 1-topping deal and get pepperoni only: The sausage isn't that great.2. Hand-tossed, 1/2 with beef, ham, & pepperoni; other 1/2 with beef, onion, mushroom, & spinach. The beef is kinda like the sausage: ""meh.""Will say that the pork topping is right in the middle of the beef and sausage (all 3 of which are ""meh"").Veggie lovers: the mushrooms are _FRESH_ (not canned like many other places), and the onions and spinach are fresh. Bull-ya for the veggie toppings, IMO!Yeah, MY 1/2 was SO ""pretty"" AND tasty!Other orders we've done include the ""boxes"" (dinner box and big family dinner box): The kids love the bread sticks and the cinnamon bread sticks. Appreciate they put the frosting on the side for the cinnamon bread sticks: 1 of my kids prefers them without, while the other loves them with it.Recap: If we got a free large ""anything"" pizza from Rewards Points, then you know we order here a lot. The rating of 4 stars is solid/consistent from our overall history."
435,1,1,"I know Pizza Hut sometimes gets a bad rap, but I'm a fan of my Brodie Pizza Hut! Let me say first, that I'm never ordering delivery. So I'm not sure that that experience is like. I live very close so I always carry out. I love that I can order everything online and take advantage of great deals. Including earning points and eventually getting FREE PIZZA! Who the heck doesn't love free pizza?!?! Anyway, they are always consistent and my order is always correct (knock on wood). They're always pretty pleasant and it's a painless experience. Order online, trust me."
436,3,2,"I'm just confused where the crust is on the bottom of this pizza... I order stuffed crust...which it had, but the bottom came out like the thinnest of the thin crust."
437,2,2,"Ordered for contactless pickup during Covid-19 pandemic. When I arrived and called the restaurant they put me on hold because they couldn't find my order. I was then told my order would be right out. Employee walked to my car a few minutes later and let me know my order was given to someone else. Had to wait for them to remake with my impatient toddler in the car. When my pizzas were ready, they took them to the wrong car first and when they brought them to me, employee reassured me with ""he didn't touch your pizzas"". She set the pizzas in my car and the boxes weren't even properly closed."
438,2,3,"The pizza here is fine, and generally speaking, the service is good too, I'm giving 2 stars because I created an account with Pizza Hut and keep getting ""digital coupons"" FOR THIS STORE that don't work.  Twice now I've gotten emails for deals on pizza and both times when I click on the deal or hand enter the coupon code or try any other variation to use them, there is ZERO impact on the price displayed.  Figure out your coupon codes or just stop sending them to me because as it exists right now it always just ticks me off and drives me to get pizza somewhere else."
439,1,1,"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this place. I was very happy with my pizza! Was made in good time, great service for my carry out, and the pizza was tasty!"
440,1,1,"This Pizza Hut location is close to a lot of residential areas, and is very speedy.  I have eaten here many times (carry out) and the staff has always been professional toward me and my fiancé. The quality of the pizza is very good. We order the same pie multiple times and while there are the usual variations in the pie, due to the nature of a restaurant like this, the quality is always great.The carryout deal for 1 large pizza of 5 toppings for $10.00 is pretty great and really helps after a long day of work.My only complaint is the way to exit for northbound Brodie Lane is not very direct."
441,2,1,Poor customer service and food quality. Pizza Hut has definitely changed over the years. Don't bother with them... go down the road to jests pizza instead. Will not be disappointed!
442,2,2,"I can not believe I call a local restaurant down the street from me and get a call center. I am not even sure it was an American call center. Shame on you Pizza Hut for out sourcing call in delivery service! I truly am dissappointed at this. I do not want talk to over seas to order my pizza from the store 4 miles from me. Funny thing is when filling out the contact us form the form asks ""did you talk to the restaurant about this feed back"" How can you when the call does not go to the restaurant. I will find a local pizza place to order. People I can talk to. By by PH. It wss a good 30 year run."
443,2,2,"Zero stars. Ordered online for a specific pick-up time. Arrived 15 min early and cashier was rude saying our order didn't exist. She said she didn't couldn't tell if kitchen had the order but she couldn't see it on her screen because we were early. I won't spell out the specific exchange of words but her tone, sarcasm, and blatant rudeness was embarrassing. I called later asking to speak to a manager and I was transferred to the same ""cashier"" that was rude to us. This time she said she was the general manager. Poor customer service and a poor example of a manager."
170,3,2,"I finally found a pizza that both my wife and I  like.Do you know what we don't like?Thievery and fraud perpetrated by the workers.Every time, that is, EVERY time we use the app to order, we pay the price listed but there's ALWAYS something missing.It's like you have to AUDIT your own order every...single...time.Especially when you order the stuffed crust or Cheese Sticks at Ave D Pizza Hut.That's right, I'm calling you out, criminals!I shouldn't hVe to check my order because the workers SEE the order from their app before they give it to me!WTF, Pizza Hut? Do you do a background check before you hire them?It wasn't once, it wasn't twice, it's every...single...time.So, my conclusion: good pizza, but felonious employees. Always, Always check your order before leaving.And those little ""Pizza Hut Express"" places? Avoid them like the plague. -Not- the same quality pizza"
445,1,1,"I usually order a pizza online from this location about twice a month. Delivery is always super fast, around 20 minutes, out of the oven fresh and always correct. Surprised at the low rating. One of the best delivery places ever for me."
446,3,1,"I really dig this place. Let me explain, more often then not there are 4-5 teenagers hanging out at my house on the weekends. Now for the most part , I'm not willing to cook for that many picky teenagers, so this place is my lifesaver. It's about 5 minutes round trip from my house and large pizzas are $5.99. Let's just say I frequent this place most weekends. And wait, it gets better. I was driving down Brodie last night and there was a guy out front with a sign saying those pizza's are $3.99 on Tuesdays. Guess what we had for dinner last night? There boxes say ""America's best value."" I'm not gonna argue with that."
447,2,3,"Little Caesars-- you were the favorite pizza place of my youth in San Antonio. How I loved your ""Simon Says"" puzzles and chocolate ravioli. I stood up to anyone on the playground who thought Pizza Hut was better. You guys came with two pizzas to a pack!Time and location changes all, apparently. You are so close to my house and have ready-to-eat pizzas available for a quick dinner solution, which is why you get two stars. But then you were given over to scary-looking managers and employees who try to be nice through their scowling. One experience in particular: they were busy and the pizza girl making the cheese bread and pizzas was pitching a fit from stress. She was working in an area right in front of us, moving slowly, whining, making sarcastic comments, and banging pans together. The manager on duty was too busy making weird jokes with the cashier to take care of the situation and so the couple of us jammed in the small waiting room cautiously watched as this girl made our food, praying it would happen soon so we could leave the madness.I work in the food industry and understand how easy it is to shut down from the stress on the busy days so I tried to be nice. I looked optimistic and friendly, smiling at her when she looked over at us for another display of childish behavior. When she threw down a box of cheese bread with a pizza and specified it as being for me, rather than the other guests who'd been waiting longer than I had, I thought I'd gotten through to her- that she'd identified me as a friend. Driving home, I was quite proud of myself and had a mental conversation of why smiles and being friendly make the world go 'round. I got home, with my stomach growling, and set the boxes on the counter. Opening up the box of my trophy cheese bread I realized something was wrong- there was no cheese! It was just a flat piece of pizza bread, cut into it's regular pieces. I had to laugh considering all my mental pats on the back, but it was ridiculous. This was no mistake from stress- she had still cut the bread in case  I might like to dip it in my marinara sauce. I've vowed to never return unless I'm dying from starvation and sub-standard, instant pizza was the only thing that could save me. Even then I might just pick up a frozen one from the store and wait that extra 20 minutes for it to cook just to ensure it wasn't made by someone who probably spit on it."
448,2,2,"I feel like all of the times I've been here were pretty bad but this last time was just terrible.  Went in to order a pizza, crazy bread and cheese sticks since they are supposed to be pre-made and ready.   Forty minutes later I had my food.  There was one person in front of me and four groups behind me and somehow everyone had their food before me.  It didn't stop the crowd from almost rioting since it took almost as long for everyone else.The guy behind me asked how long it would take for his food to be ready when he ordered since he had his kids with him and the girl said 8 minutes which would be reasonable.  Twenty minutes later he asked again and she replied 8 minutes.  After that she kind of incompetently ran around asking everyone what they had about twice before getting them the food.Somehow they don't use technology to keep things in order.  Even though she tendered my order correctly they made my pizza, then made the cheese bread twenty minutes later.  She couldn't even get the dipping sauces I ordered correctly.  She asked me three times what sauces I wanted and still didn't give me the correct ones.I won't be going back anytime soon to say the least.  Whoever ones the place should seriously work on training their guys."
449,2,2,"I ordered from the internet and it was delivered without any of my toppings. The girl at the store said I should call to verify my order. I asked for a manager and was told she was with a customer. Bobby got on and claimed he was the manager. Wow, 2 managers in that tiny little carry out only store. Bobby offered to send another pizza out, but it would take 45 minutes or he could give me a $10 credit, even though I paid $13.50. Bobby told me that he gets multiple complaints about the internet ordering being incorrect. He told me I should just call. I did call and write Pizza Hut corporate office. The good thing about this area is that 5 other pizza places deliver here, so I do not need to waste my money at Pizza Hut."
450,2,2,"Ordered a large thin crust half pepperoni, half cheese pizza (delivered). Absolutely the worst pizza ever from a Pizza Hut or anywhere. It was way over cooked, looked like it had been under one of those heat lamps for a few hours. inedible"
451,1,3,"This is *not* a two-star Pizza Hut. Maybe some people had some bad one-off experiences, and that's unfortunate, but I've ordered from here probably 10+ times and the food is never late or slow (delivery or pickup), and the quality is consistent. So for what a Pizza Hut is, this is a 5-star Pizza Hut."
452,2,2,"So i went and order online. Gave pizza hut a call to replace my blue cheese with ranch (same price, an easy change). Overall, they voided my order when making a change. Management was horrible and blamed it on me and said it was my fault for making a change. They dont take apple pay in store, so i had no method to paying when i had already payed for it via apple pay online. Lot's of trouble. Management decided to blame it on me and took all the items i had. They dont tell you they voided your order until you're there in store."
453,3,2,Very average pizza with too much cheese and oil. Much better options at other places.
454,3,3,Food was good. The reason why I gave them 3 stars because they didn't have my order on time and I told the lady what car I was in so she could place my order on the hood and she gave my food to another customer. Who was driving a complete different vehicle and a color car. And proceeded to ask me if this was my order?
455,3,1,Your average pizza hut. They've always gotten my orders right and I usually don't do delivery so I can't speak on the service.Never gotten an undercooked pizza and always gotten enough toppings on my pies :)Happy with everything they have to offer.
456,2,2,"this place is almost Laughably disgusting and rundown. workers literally Laying around surrounded by trash crowding the restaurant, ridiculously long wait times for below average pizzas."
457,1,1,"Love this Pizza Hut location!  I treat my coworkers to pizza about once a month and the pizzas are always well made with no shortage of toppings and ready to pick up when I arrive.  Fast, friendly staff make the experience a positive one consistently. Going to this Pizza Hut has spoiled me when it comes to others in the Austin metro area."
458,1,1,"This Pizza Hut has construction nearby, so it can be tricky to drive in if you are picking up or dining in.The reviews for this particular chain are pretty awful, but I think that is mostly due to delivery problems. I came here to dine in with a friend for lunch. We split a large, pepperoni pizza with the new honey sriracha crust. No joke, this is probably one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. The new crust has a really nice sweet and spicy flavor. In addition, the marinara sauce and pepperoni are so tasty. The texture of the pizza is perfectly crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. If the pizza wasn't 10000 calories, I could probably eat it everyday. Based on previous reviews, I probably won't be getting delivery from this Pizza Hut in the future, but I will be sure to stop by for lunch."
459,2,2,"I have to wonder if Spencer G. knows Brianna personally, because of all of the reviews that mention that manager by name, his is the only one that discusses her in glowing terms. Her service is terrible, and she clearly doesn't care about the fact that driving away business.I had an awful experience with her a little over a week ago. I called about a mistake on my order, and instead of just offering to fix it, she became argumentative and combative, offering sarcastic comments and laughing when I kept trying to get her to calm down and understand what I needed. Instead of continuing this ridiculous conversation with her, I called the corporate customer service line to report her lack of professionalism. I seldom do this, because the person whom the complaint is about usually gets reamed, but in this case, Brianna completely deserved it. My advice to upper management would be to let her go find a job that suits her, and bring in people who understand the basics of GOOD customer service."
460,1,1,"Consistency has been off for the last five years. However in the last few months, food has been so good every time. Pizzas are cooked perfectly, and you can't sleep on that pan crust."
461,2,1,"Stopped in for the buffet today.   Honestly, I didn't expect great pizza, but just a variety of different stuff.So, here's what just under $9 got me (besides a drink).  When I got there just after opening, I was able to get some pepperoni pizza, which went quickly.  They also had some varieties of supreme and/or veggie pizzas which sat around.   Same for the sausage pizza.   No cheese pizza (a staple) at all.   Also, unlike some buffets, nobody at Pizza Hut asks if there's anything you'd like to see on the buffet.  Finally, I had a serving of a surprisingly good pasta casserole with spiral pasta, ground beef, tomato sauce, and cheese.Bluntly, while nothing was disgusting and what was available was pretty good, it felt to me like this Pizza Hut really is just ""mailing it in"" on their buffet."
462,2,3,"Not the delivery drivers fault however I live 5 minutes from this Pizza Hut and had to wait over 2 hours to get my pizza and it was cold, they really need to step up there game"
463,2,3,I rated two star because the pizza i ordered was tasty and the guy who delivered it was a good guy.....they gave an expired hershey's chocolate dipping sauce...
464,2,2,"Wish they had negative stars. Ordered pizza on a Sunday evening and the confirmation said it would be delivered at 710p. Called at 730 and the very rude and unprofessional clerk Brianna who answered said it would be another 40 minutes (ordered at 615p) before we would get our pizza. Said they only had one driver. Then she had the nerve to blame us for not coming to pick up the pizza, basically condemning us for picking delivery!!! We cancelled the order and walked to eat. Over $70 in pizza ordered and they were completely rude. When I asked for a refund they charged my card a second time!! Next day called to speak to the manager and we were told we had to email corporate to get a refund. What a joke, worst customer service ever. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. SERIOUS MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS."
465,2,2,"Second time to call first-time said would take an hour and a half second time said two hours .Used to  love Pizza Hut but their service is getting worse and worse every time I call different pizza huts ,"
466,2,2,"I ordered a pizza to be delivered to me yesterday. Delivery man gets to my place, I open the pizza box- wrong pizza, not even close. The man offers to go back to pizza hut and come back with the right pizza (he said it would take 30-40 mins). I said sure, thanks! He come back 30 mins later....still the wrong pizza, not even close to what I ordered and the pizza looked a mess. Thanks for the effort dude. I would not recommend this pizza hut- I know it's close to campus, but there is a Papa John's, a Domino's, even a 7/11 near by with great pizza."
467,2,2,"This is by far THE WORST SERVICE I've ever had.I placed my order online for 1 Pizza at 8pm (expected delivery 9:30pm). It is now 12:30 am and my food isn't here. I called at 10pm to find out what's going on and they said it'll be about 30 more minutes. I call again at 11:30pm and they tell me ""it's on its way."" I'm pretty sure it doesn't take an hour to drive 5 blocks.This is about the 3rd time this happened and i've had it with this fraud of a business. They never let the customer know if the wait time will be longer and they haven't even offered an apology or some compensation. Also, when the food DOES get here, most of the time the pizza is crushed on the side of the box. Furthermore, the drivers tell you to come down to pick up the pizza if you live in an apt complex (even though I write the gate code in my message). Dominos and Papa johns deliver straight to the door. If im going down to ground level to pick up pizza, I might as well save myself time and delivery charge to get in my car and pick up the food myself.Worst experience ever and I hope this place goes out of business.*****UPDATE******I just called to ""rectify"" this issue. I started out saying ""Can I talk to your manager, I've been waiting for my pizza since 8."" The guy asks for my address then responds ""I am the manger here and oh that order is on its way already.""""That's funny because I placed that order at 8pm last night""""(long pause), ok let me transfer you to somone else.""After explaining my situation they tell me they will refund my money and give me a $10 credit for my next order since it's 2pm. ""What's that supposed to mean?"" I asked. ""Well sir, if you called us earlier when we opened we could have given you a $20 credit.""I'm sorry but they made be wait over 5 hours for NO food then tell me that they COULD have given me $20 but because I'm a normal human being and have stuff to do on a Monday morning that I don't qualify for more credit??? EVERYONE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND DONT LET THESE PEOPLE STEAL FROM YOU!"
468,3,3,"It's a long story how this pizza snob ended up at Pizza Hut, so I won't bore you with it. Instead, I want to report that I had a good pizza. I'd like it if they put the mop away, rather than leave it by the tables, but the place was decently clean...and judging by the mop, perhaps recently cleaned."
469,2,2,"Food ok, poor customer service!!! The cashier clearly does not like her job!  I asked what was on the quick eats menu, she said she didn't know. I asked for a quick eats menu and she said she didn't have one and the only thing I could do was look at the  sign outside on the window. I literally had to go outside into the parking lot to look at the sign on the window. I should've  kept walking but my kids really wanted pizza. She was so RUDE!!!!!! Will never be back!!!"
470,2,3,"While living in L.A., I ordered frequently from Pizza Slut because there really weren't a lot of decent options. I must say I was always pleased. In Chicago -- land of pizza (yes, even thin crust) --- I only ordered once because of a great deal. Otherwise, there is no reason to order from Pizza Hut in a city like Chicago or New York. The Pizza Hut store on Howard in Chicago's Roger's Park was surprisingly good and did not skimp on toppings. Perhaps it was because Chicago boasts some of the best pizza in the world - deep, pan or thin crust. My brother warned me that he had a hard time finding decent pizza in Austin -- but I have faith I will find it -- by reading Yelp reviews. Most of the time I am partial to New York style pizza -- the foldable, generous cheese topping type. And this definitely is NOT it. Not that I ever thought it would be. We had a coupon that my brother got due to their screwing up an order. Maybe they skimped because he told them about the coupon before we placed the order. While that would be stupid -- especially if they want to entice us to come back -- this is the kind of place that would do just that. And they sure did. One word: YUK. The worst pizza I have ever had. They skimped so much on this Meat Lover's pizza that it was more like focaccia bread. In fact, I've had better focaccia bread and would have preferred it.I don't know as I would ever try the buffet, but I might -- since I love a bargain. For now, the remainder of the pizza is in the freezer in individual slices and when I decide to have one, I will doctor it up with a LOT more mozzarella cheese and perhaps other stuff."
471,3,1,"It seemed like such a good idea at the time. Well, it seemed like a good idea after a friend and I had had some wine. Pizza Hut. Beer from 7-11. Flashback to college. I should have known better. I should have continued to fight for Bestwurst. But then he said, ""When will you ever eat a P'zone if not with me, right now?"" The answer is never, and there's probably a good reason for that.  Plus: - It was ready in 12 minutes.- Perfect for our ravenous selves. The workers were super friendly.- Not as overwhelmingly greasy as I thought it was going to be.- Pairs well with Budweiser SelectMinus: - No one, NO ONE, needs over a pound of meat and cheese. Your body will revolt. Trust me. (I only ate half and I was rolling around like Tempelton at the fair in Charlotte's Web. Seriously.)It's Pizza Hut, you know what you're getting into. Now, think twice."
472,1,1,"Great pizza, It's better than the other pizza huts ive been to. Convenient location and great service as well. I got my pizza with 8 mins of ordering"
473,2,2,"Called Pizza Hut for delivery and they said it would be delivered in an hour and a half. We waited and finally called when nothing was delivered. ""Oh sorry we are backed up and it will be at least another hour."" Canceled the order and called Dominos and they said we will be here in 20 minutes."
474,3,3,"My best Pizza Hut experiences have always involved an awesome buffet. However, the buffet at this location sucks. You'll find old pizza, cold pizza, crappy pizza, and the buffet is just dirty.Take out and delivery have always been fine, although I'm definitely apt to pick up my pizza and avoid the delivery fee + dumb obligation to tip."
475,3,1,"I tried ""Wingstreet"" here a couple nights ago, taking out 10 ""Burnin' Hot"" wings and cheesy breads for about $11.  I chose ""traditional"" wings, though breaded ""bone-in"" and boneless ""bone-out"" are also available.  Wings are midsized and cooked right, with plenty of sauce.  It's only hot when it's really accumulated on the wings, and then in the neighborhood of Hotter at Wing Zone or Bam at Ba-da-Wings of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  There was a hint of tomato or something in the sauce that I wasn't keen on, but you might like it. Cheesy breads were delicious and provided adequate heat relief.While waiting for my order, I noticed that Pizza Hut is still using those unique oval-shaped plates at their buffet.  I had not thought about these impractical plates in many, many years.  Overall, seeing them was a positive aspect of my dining experience.Considering how much testing and nitpicking a company like Yum! must go through before launching a new food product - let alone a new brand - Wingstreet is poorly executed.  I sought to use a coupon for 20 wings at $10.99, but you can't mix flavors, and who wants 20 wings of the same flavor on their first visit to a wing joint.  With online ordering, you can't mix flavors no matter how many you get, so you have to pay (more) separately if you want multiple sauces.  They don't even have blue cheese, but will sell you some ranch for a buck.  These are rookie mistakes unbecoming a five-year-old brand with over 1200 locations in the United States, Australia, and Canada."
476,2,2,placed order online and then after waiting 40 minutes in the store got a refund.  I asked multiple times.  First thing cashier said was I  am glad I don't work back there.  The I told the manager I had waited 40 minutes so far and she said wow.  Nothing no apology nothing.  Got a refund.
477,2,2,While I in no way shape or form expect any type of frills from PIzza Hut I should also say even with these low expectations going into my order I am still disappointed.  I feel like delivery pizza has had its time and that has way passed.  I chose to order delivery tonight so that I could get my food quicker than if I had done another delivery service full of restaurants to choose from.  I was HUNGRY!  The guy gets here after an hour and a half confused if I paid and with cold pizza.  If you are only going to have a couple of drivers delivering pizza on a Sunday maybe you should get to hiring.
478,2,2,Had to wait 3+ hours for a pizza on a regular Sunday night. I ordered at 930 expecting it to get here and 1045. its now 1230 and still no pizza and they won't answer their phone. isn't this business based on delivery? yikes.
479,2,2,"I gave one star to this PH because Yelp requires me to. The food at this PH is horrible and the management is even worse.A very close friend of mine started a job at this location not too long ago and was horribly harassed by one of the managers, who is apparently extremely homophobic. Upon meeting my friend, he immediately started making remarks about how ""This isn't San Francisco."" He treated my friend like dirt the entire shift. Then, when my friend came back to work delivery, he had a female manager that was great. But once this guy came in for his shift and saw my friend working, he grabbed his crotch in front of all of the employees and said ""This isn't San Francisco."" He kept saying things like this over the next few hours while my friend tried to ignore it and work. The manager would give him an order, my friend would make the order and prep it for delivery and then the manager would tell him he took him off that order and give it to someone else. He did this seven times before my friend had finally had more than he could take. Other employees were even telling the guy that my friend could have their orders and that they didn't think it was fair to treat him this way. The manager wouldn't let that happen, so my friend called the other manager and quit.This may not be San Francisco, but it is Austin--a town that celebrates diversity and honors peoples differences. This kind of treatment of other human beings has no place in this town.I will NEVER spend a dime in this PH EVER again and I will make sure that none of my friends do either."
480,1,3,"Had an incorrect order today but the manager Howard was awesome and took care of the problem right away.  I can understand any restaurant having problems, but it's how those problems are taken care of that makes all the difference.  This Pizza Hut gets my thumbs up for having an awesome approach at handling a wrong order."
175,1,1,"Dear People of the World,Do you like pizza? Yes or no? Do you like toppings on your pizza? If you like pizza, then come to Ascend Charter School.  Because there is a Pizza Hut store at this school! At Pizza Hut, there are many pizzas that are amazing!  One reason Pizza Hut is the best, is the pizzas are cheesy. They put stretchy cheese on top of the pizza.  They also put melted cheese inside the pizza crust. When I eat the cheese, it feels like I'm in cheesy heaven.  A second reason is, they put pineapples on the pizza. You can also get it with no pineapples. You can make your own pizza with whatever toppings you want, like pepperoni or mushrooms. All the toppings are delicious. You should get it when you get out of school or work or anytime you are hungry. From,Penn State"
386,2,3,"I have been to this location twice. The first time...no complaints. However, the second time they messed up my order. I gave them two stars instead of one because they gave me a free pizza in order to make up for the mistake they made with my original pizza. The reason I gave such a low rate is because while waiting for my pizza, I saw something that made me throw out all three pizzas as soon as I left the store. The guys in the back were eating wings and one of them was picking the chicken out of his teeth. After he got it out, he went back to making pizzas. Ever since I saw that...I think about this place and it makes me lose my appetite. Sucks because it is in walking distance from my house, but I will go out of my way to avoid this place and give a different pizza place my business."
444,2,1,"I actually didn't realize these guys were still around until I passed this location on my way home the other day. I vaguely recall eating one of their pizzas when I was in high school, and thinking it was good. So when I was craving pizza the other night, I checked their website for the number, and gave them a call. The website lists seven pre-made pizza options, as well as a section for ""Custom Pizza"", which, as the name suggests, is a pizza that you, the ""customer"", ""customize"" yourself. You'll get why I'm using all the quotes here in a minute. Just be patient. So the ""Custom Pizza"" - that's what I wanted.Here's how the conversation started:Me: I'd like to order a Custom Pizza.Her: A custom pizza, what's that?Me: A custom pizza? Well, Your website lists some pre-made pizzas, and then a section for Custom Pizza..Her: I don't know what that is. I've never heard of that before. What is that? What is a custom pizza?Me: It's a pizza that I pick the toppings for, that I customize..Her: Ok, fine, all right, so what do you want?Me: Black olives, mushrooms and pineapple.Her: That'll be 8 dollars, ready in 15 minutes.Me: Well, how many people will that serve?Her: It's cut into 8 slices.Me: Well, how big are the slices?Her: We can cut them into more slices if you want?Me: Ok, but how big are the slices?Her: 8.Me: What?Her: Do you have any other questions?Me: Well, I'm not sure I understand how big it is.. I guess I want two of them just in case..Her: Well, I already ran up the first one, so I'll have to ring up another one.Me: Ok.Her: Do you want me to ring up another one?Me: Yes.Her: That'll be 8 dollars, ready in 15 minutes (then hangs up).The pizza was gross, btw."
