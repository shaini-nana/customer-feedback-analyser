1,1,4,"This place has come a long way over the last few years. Until recently, the service was dreadful and the length of time it took to get a simple pepperoni pizza and breadsticks could be as early as 45 minutes if the place was empty and as far as refills, forget about it. So we just stopped going in and would order for pick-up before making the 30 minute drive to get it. About 6 months ago, one of my kids insisted on eating inside the restaurant. I was shocked to see a full staff and the server was attentive and the pizza was delicious. I was so surprised that it tasted like the Pizza Hut pizza I enjoyed so much when I was a kid, 400 miles away. Overall, I give it a 4-star rating. The server we usually have is great but some of the other staff I've encountered aren't as friendly."
5,2,2,"Worst Pizza Hut pizza ever! Online order estimated 30 minutes for our order and it took over an hour to receive.  ...it took more than 30 minutes to get here after receiving the notification that it was ""on its way"" - and we're only 3 miles away! Needless to say our order was cold."
6,1,1,New decor work's.  Lunch buffet very busy but bar's remained full at all time's.  Very friendly service.
7,2,2,Terrible waiter and her name was patti!!!!Súper Slow and gets orders confused. Was behind on delivery's!
8,2,2,"It's already bad enough because it's a Pizza Hut so obviously it's not going to be great. But then they discontinued their gluten-free pizza crust that the rest of the company still sells, which is a huge middle finger to customers who need it. If there are 10 pizza places within 5 miles of here, all 10 of them are better than this dump."
2,2,2,"Waited 3 hours for a messed up order, wouldn't refund unless I RETURNED the pizza after it was opened in my home. Absolutely no regard for COVID guidelines. I'm completely disgusted."
10,1,1,"My brother and I stopped by this Pizza Hut after a visit to the Botanical Gardens mostly for nostalgic reasons. The staff is courteous and the service is excellent.  We arrived early on Saturday morning, so we were the first to order.  Our orders were cooked freshly and to order, which I appreciate.  Given that the food is made to order, there is a bit of a wait (20+ minutes), even for relatively small orders (one personal pie), but there are black chairs to sit down to wait until one's order is ready if one walks to the restaurant rather than drives and parks in front.  The restaurant is clean and the menu is easy to read. Unfortunately, this Pizza Hut doesn't deliver to my address even though I am about 1.5 miles away (Bed-Stuy). The manager was at the restaurant that day, pleasantly greeted us, and told us that our orders would be ready soon (we ordered a dinner box and six personal supreme pies). Our pizzas were slightly under-cooked, but otherwise tasted fantastic. I would definitely come here again, that is, if I am in the area. The attention to customer service, the tasty food, and the fact that there are few Pizza Huts left in NYC, make this a great stop for pizza or if one just wants to experience an old American pizza franchise."
11,2,1,"As I'm sitting waiting for my pizza, I have mixed emotions about my experience. I decided to start my review and I want to be fair on all levels, so I'm going to start with the good.As I walked into the establishment employee behind the cash register did greet me oh, I gave him my order number he seemed very pleasant. I sat there for a few another customer walked in and he did ask her if she wanted to hear the specials of the day. And that's where the positives ends.The negatives begin, when you walk into the door of the Pizza Hut.  It smells as though a clean mop has not been used and there is garbage on the floor. I walked out to sit in my car because the smell has become overbearing. When I walked back in to see if my food was ready, I was greeted with an empty space (no one was at the front) I stood there for good five minutes saying hello hello before anyone came in the front to see what I wanted. That same employee that greeted me nicely, as I turned to ask him another question I noticed that he's head is down in his phone."
12,2,2,Pizza Hut doesn't actually deliver you food to your door. I order delivery all the time and never had this happen to me. Had I know I would have walked the 2 blocks to buy a decent slice. I guess it's been awhile since I've had a Pizza Hut pizza but the quality has gone way down hill. I ordered extra cheese but this pizza had barely enough cheese top call it pizza. Waited almost an hour for 1 medium pie. Ugh. I learned my lesson. I'll never eat Pizza Hut again!
13,2,2,The POS went down I had to wait for carry out order for more than 40 mins. One of the employees touched the phone with food handling gloves and didn't even bother to discard them and put on a new pair of gloves. Staff needs to be retrained in proper food handling procedures.
4,2,2,"Very dirty, heard the workers talking about going outback to smoke pot. Very disappointing business. Food was cold. Left it sitting out for a long time before they even brought it to me. My husband and I will never be going back that's for sure. Left a 5 dollar tip and heard the waitress talking about how I didn't leave a big enough tip for her."
15,2,2,"I want to make clear, I'm giving this rating not because there was anything wrong with the food or the service, but for one reason and one reason only.  This branch of Pizza Hut hates apartments.  They have this horrible policy which says that their delivery person can't come into the building, so anyone ordering from an apartment has to come downstairs to the front door and pick up the food.  Have a baby sleeping and can't leave?  Tough.  Feeling sick and need to stay in?  Too bad.  Not only do you have to pay a delivery fee, but they won't even bring it to your front door.  And I love Pizza Hut pizza!  In fact, I want to be ordering from them right now.  Know why I'm not?  Because I don't want to have to walk downstairs to pick up food when I paid for delivery.  This seems to be a frequent complaint from what I've seen of reviews.  I don't know why they'd continue with a policy that's clearly losing them business."
16,2,2,"This place has really turned me off to Pizza Hut. Last I ordered, the pie was ridiculously undercooked. This time, it was so over cooked I basically got a biscuit with grease on it. Moreover, we had to pick up the pizza after being told over the phone that they are ""not doing deliveries tonight."" When we got there, pizzas were leaving for delivery. The cashier was courteous but this establishment needs a complete revamp! I'm never eating from here again. I certainly don't pay the taxes I do in this area to have sub par Pizza Hut franchises unnecessarily opened here."
17,1,1,The most courteous staff I've encountered at any Pizza Hut. I messed up my online order and they took care of it and kept apologizing and checking in with me while I waited.
14,2,2,"They gave me food that wasn't cooked!!!!I ordered two large pizzas and cheese bread at 8:15pm on a Tuesday. The food arrived at 9pm and the driver seemed to rush away. I found out when I opened the pizza boxes that he must have taken a hard turn or dropped my boxes because the pizzas had slid to one side, and the slices were out of place.One of our pizzas had a lot of vegetables on it, but the spinach looked like it was placed on top after the pizza came out of the oven. And when we picked up slices of each pizza, they felt like bread that hadn't been put into the oven for more than a minute or two. It was like holding bread with melted cheese on top. On top of that, both of the pizzas were supposed to have flavored crusts, but they didn't.Then I opened the box for the cheese bread and it actually was bread with melted cheese just placed on top. It was spongy and definitely not cooked properly.At the very least, this has to be a health issue. We refused to eat it and I tried to call the store. I would always end up having to go through a phone menu, but when I tried to get to the customer service line, the system would hang up on me. This happened FIVE times.So I chose a different menu option and had to do this SEVEN different times, speaking to SEVEN different operators who were absolutely no help. They would assure me that someone would pick up when I was transferred, but it never happened. I asked the final operator why no one could connect me with the physical store, and he tried to tell me that the store didn't have a phone... When I called him on it, he transferred me but the call was dropped again. By that time, the store was closed (yes, it had been an hour of trying to get some sort of customer service) and the system wouldn't forward me anymore.So, to all of those people who said they had ""Great Customer Service Experience,"" I wish I had the operators that you did. But for others, know that there is the very real possibility of not getting any help at all if you have an issue with your order. Pizza Hut as a whole has lost my business."
19,2,2,"This Pizza Hut is by far the worst!!!Buyer Beware!!!I ordered 36 wings and cheesy bread, once I got the wings in my car it smelled like sweaty gym socksI called the store and spoke with the manager and received no sort of remorse, sympathy, nothing, she told me it's nothing she could do! Smdh!!!The quality of the food is subpar, the employees are not customer service oriented at all!!This is NYC there are far more places that sell quality pizza this establishment needs to go!This is my last visit to this Pizza Hut, I now will travel to get quality pizza and great customer service. I work in an industry where I deal with people and provide service with a smile. Pizza Hut, you, along with Red Lobster and Olive Garden have just lost a hardworking customer.The food industry is already killing us with all the GMO's and such in the foods and I also have to put up with bad food and lousy customer service?"
20,2,2,"I will never order from them nomore. I'v been waiting for my pizza 1hour and 45mins to be delivered, never again shame on them.. And I love Pizza Hut.."
21,1,1,This review is strictly on carry out orders. I am so satisfied with ordering from here. I placed my order ahead of time and they gave me 20 min wait for it to be ready. Exactly when I arrived my order was ready for me to pay and go. That is the best it can get. I absolutely hate when you order and get a wait time and when you get there you are still waiting. Definitely not the case here. Plus food was warm and fresh absolutely no complains right now.
22,2,2,"Pizza Hut is one of my favorite pizza chains. However this Pizza Hut disappointed in their customer service. The lady who took my order did not take it correctly. After a 20 minute wait I receive my order only to find out that their are wings missing . After explaining to her that I ordered wings she proceeds to tell me that I did not and if I would like some to pay again . I refused and she than called the manager . The manager told me their was nothing he could do because of ""inventory"".  He also proceeded to tell me that he heard her repeat the order and nothing was wrong. I am blown away at how he would not compensate me or try to offer me anything for the misunderstanding . Obviously the customer is always right does not stand a chance at this location and if I were you I would steer clear of this place . I surely will."
23,2,2,I would give 0 stars if I could. This is disgraceful. Pizza Hut is usually up there when it comes to national pizza chains but this is the most awful tasting pizza I've had in a good long while. I will not be buying from this Pizza Hut again and would definitely not recommend ordering from here. Barely any cheese on the slices and the bacon was more bacon fat pieces than anything. The crust was crunchy and hard.
3,2,2,"After waiting forever for our food, they ended up messing up our pizza. We never got our wings. We ordered cheesy bread sticks and the waitress brought us slices of bread with cheese. Which isn't even on the menu? Our waitress was friendly and the food wasn't terrible but not worth the wait"
24,4,1,"While I like there is a pizza hut around Brooklyn, they need one close to my house. The food is good buy to go all the way to empire for it stinks."
26,2,2,"Absolutely HORRIBLE!! This is the SECOND time I've experienced such poor customer service at this location. The previous time I placed an order, I didn't receive it, when I called back and asked for a refund the woman who answered the phone told me they would not be back out and I could not receive a refund, only a store credit. She did not give me her name and then proceeded to not answer the phone when I called back.  Now, this current situation I placed an order at 5pm, I didn't receive any contact until after 7. I wrote a note saying to buzz my apt, for some reason the driver and management just kept calling my phone which I didn't hear but that is beyond the point. Finally I received a buzz at my door, we rang him in and he did not come up or call us again. So my husband went downstairs and the driver was gone. The manager Saran (*sp) cancelled my order and when I called instead of being apologetic she told me that the driver didn't have to come up and that was it! I told her that my husband went downstairs and he was gone, all she said was its policy for them not to come up. HUH? First where is this policy and second why isn't it listed when I place my order? Thirdly, two other drivers have come up before. Furthermore, my husband went downstairs, we have a 6 floor building, apparently this driver waited all of 2 minutes.They need to close down this branch, it is really tarnishing the Pizza Hut name!"
25,1,1,"I've never asked for anything to be delivered so I can't really speak on it but as far as carry out, this Pizza Hut receives five stars. I have never had a problem and since its been open I probably order Pizza Hut once or twice a week or at least once every two and have always been satisfied. Food is fresh and always ready when I get there."
28,2,2,Their service is horrendous...they look at u with attitude and don't pay attention.  And their floor is dirty
9,2,2,Not even worth a single star....service was bad food was cold. All the manager could say when told was it won't be like this next time... There won't be a next time!!!!!!! I will go to Papa John's
29,2,2,"I don't like paying for a service that I do not receive. The standard delivery fee is $3 to deliver the food to your door.  Apparently this location does not go in your building. The point of delivery is to have the food come to you. I paid an extra $3 so I didn't have to get dressed and go outside to get my food...i might as well have walked to the store myself. Their marinara sauce is the worse one I've ever treated, and the honey Sriracha was not hot at all, they put too much honey. This will be my first and last time ordering from this location and from pizza hut. Back to Papa Johns"
27,2,2,"I am very unsatisfied with the delivery service of this location. I ordered cheese sticks and boneless chicken at 7:57 pm. I only live 7 blocks away and finally received the order at 9:17 pm. It is cold, not even warm."
31,2,4,"I love Pizza Hut just hate that this one is the one closest to me smh almost 2 hours still waiting for, this location is now closed smh took them long enough"
30,2,2,Came in an hour but yet it was cold and stale - will never order again.When I called the person who answered seems like I was bothering her and was barely audibleHuge disappointment - now I remember why I don't order this crap
18,2,2,"Pizza was ok, I mean it's not New York pizza, it's Pizza Hut!Service leaves something to be desired and the pricing is a bit off given both notions above."
32,4,1,"Having Pizza Hut in NY should be a crime, but hey we all got our cravings sometimes! Being from Cali and growing up with Pizza Hut brings back childhood nostalgia! Ah the memories...Had a craving for the stuffed crust pizza and got an awesome deal of $13 large 2 topping stuffed crust pizza. We also ordered the wing street buffalo wings which were not bad...Def a break back into childhood memories!"
33,2,2,Apparently their website doesn't know they closed... Don't mind me. I have to keep on writing. They apparently want Tolstoy for reviews.
34,2,2,"Worst Pizza Hut location in all of New York. I used to go to this one a lot growing up, and stopped because they consistently started having horrible service and horrible food. I went back to give it another try this past week and it's just gotten worse. The lady in the front was unbelievably lazy and rude and did not care whatsoever. I ordered two mediums with three toppings, and received uncooked pizza. One of the toppings was spinach and I don't know if they thought they were being smart/funny but they just threw it in the box on the side.  So is that how Pizza Hut does a pizza topping now?"
35,2,2,"I don't know how Pizza Hut could get a medium cheese and pepperoni pizza wrong not once, not twice but 3 times!!!  I went in to the store and ordered a cheese and pepperoni pizza the cashier said it would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I waited in the store as he was on his cell phone taking personal calls and not paying attention to the orders coming out.  25 minutes later I asked him if the pizza sitting on the counter was mine.  He asked me what I ordered and that it was a cheese pizza and not mine, he asked the cook to make my pizza again since the order somehow disappeared. Another 15 minutes later the cook asked the cashier what I ordered he said ""oops i made the wrong thing, I made half cheese and olives, I will start the order now""  An hour later and the 3rd attempt at a simple pizza,  I finally get my cheese and pepperoni. I got home and opened it up and it was not cooked, the dough was still raw.  I wanted to avoid food poisoning so the whole thing went in the trash! The worst part of it all is the cashier was the manager,  he has no work ethic at all and should be fired!"
36,2,2,"Ordered a large supreme without pepperoni. i got instead a chicken pizza with olives. The driver Jose called me to come downstairs and hung up the phone abruptly. Then I found out it was the wrong pizza. Since pizza hut was already closed, I couldnt call the store directly to tell them  this wasnt my pizza, so I called the driver Jose who just avoided my calls. Dont order from here. Waste of time and money."
38,2,2,Just received my delivery order from this Pizza Hut. Pizza was cold and not cut into slices. My mozzarella sticks were cold and saggy. And to top it all... I ordered Hershey's triple chocolate brownies and received a chocolate chip cookie. Definitely not ordering again from this place #pizzahut
37,2,2,Can't give less than a star. Delivery time takes forever and they mess up on the order. Haven't ordered here in years... now I know why.
39,2,2,"My wife and I both got food poisoned from here. What's worse, it was the carb-loading meal the night before a marathon, so not only did they destroy our bodies, but also the race. Absolute worst place ever."
40,1,1,"Wow, my experience is totally different from the previous reviews...maybe because I only do carryout and not delivery. The greatest advice I could give you is to call-in and place your order. This way, when you arrive, you can skip the long line of people ordering, pay&pick up your food and leave. It will save you a lot of time! The staff are awesome, especially William! I admire there ability to work consistently despite the large volume of phone orders and walk-ins. The only negative thing I could say would be their removal of the traditional hot wing size. Now their traditional hot wings are insanely huge and taste differently."
41,2,2,"Horrible delivery service. Ordered at 7:15pm and was expecting the food to be delivered at 8pm. 8:05pm food still hasn't arrived. 8:15 called the store, they said they're running late since there are multiple deliveries  (not my problem). Called again at 8:25 and they said it would be 5 mins. MIND YOU my family is fasting and we were due to break our fast at 8:32pm. The time comes, no food. I call and cancel the order and receive attitude by the employee. I cancel my order and she confirms that I will not be charged.It's 8:50 and the delivery man calls saying that he is out front buzzing the door. I go outside, no one is there. Meanwhile I can hear the GPS on the phone directing him to drive to my house. Once this idiot arrives I tell him that he is 50mins late and that I cancelled the order. He stands there like a moron and says ""I'm late sorry but I had a lot of deliveries"" once again I remind him that it's not my problem! I ordered more than an hour ago and was suppose to receive my food an hour ago. Then I tell him that if he gives the food I am not paying for it. He shrugs his shoulder and nods no because it will come out his paycheck.LONG STORY SHORT: order from domino's because they have a tracker and are a lot more reliable. Pizza Hut SUCKS"
42,2,2,"RATS AND ROACHES (perhaps)So you're gonna charge me a $3.00 delivery fee to show up an hour and a half later with a cold pizza and complain about how I didn't answer the phone for a half hour ? You sat in the car calling me for 30 Mins ..instead of simply getting out of the car and ringing the door bell . Rats.And then you actually admit that you waited a half hour to ring the bell.And are riffing about it to me the minute I open my door . Roaches.That's not the first time you pulled that . You need to understand,people do not want to leave their apartments to come downstairs and go meet you at your car down the block . It defeats the purpose of ordering in . You guys need to get it together. You are all horrible at your jobs .The level of ineptitude displayed there is pathetic . I can't see it being a clean ,sanitary store with this bum attitude you all have . Cutting corners on the simplest of tasks . You are all bums . And that location is infested with RATS AND ROACHES !!  (That last sentence is an assumption but not a long shot by any means ) RATS AND ROACHES EVERYWHERE!!!"
43,2,2,Hand tossed pizza always burned!! This location to learn how to make pizzas and breadsticks like the target Pizza Hut pizza!!! Seriously need re training.  My cheese pizzas are always burnt.  Very disappointing.
44,2,2,"PZ DONT GO!!! Save ur money .. this food is crap , they are scammers ...... today I called after watching an amazing promo in tv about any large pizza for 10$ with any topics , then I decide to give them a call asking if they do delivery by my house , after talking to a guy on the phone they told me that my address is out and they can't delivery, so we decide to order over the phone and then go to pick it up. Story short the person over the phone told me ."" We have a better deal 2 large pizza with any topping and wings for 25$"" I said ohh ok I'll get that .. my husband went to get the pizza and payed 39$ WHY!!!!!!!!!! I called them to complain and they told me we never told u this !!?? This is for online orders ???? Ok are u serious ??? I would never older to this place ever again . Pizza is very small and no taste at all..."
45,2,2,"Me and my girlfriend brought pizza there,and we both got food poisoning for three whole days wish I knew how to give this place negative stars after the pain we went throu"
46,2,2,"This Pizza Hut is the most absolute sorry excuse of a business. Yesterday I ordered 3 pies and the delivery guy showed up with 2 and said the staff forgot to mention the third pie. Then he lied and said another driver was coming in 2 minutes with my pie but the same driver ended up showing up an HOUR later with the wrong pie that I did not order... When I called them, they didn't seem to care much nor did they apologize to me for BOTH mishaps and I swear I will never order Pizza Hut again thanks to them! Disgusting staff."
47,2,4,I wonder why you work in such place .when you are not happy to work . poor service every time I order in website its says 30 min but always deliver after 1 hours 15 min. And some time after waiting that long they forget food which they charge for. Customer service representative Please find another job where you see yourself happy! Don't waste time money and time here!! Try local pizza store!!
48,2,2,"This is THE worst pizza hut I've had pizza from ever.  I ordered online only to find out that they completely forgot my order even though they were able to find the ticket for it.  When I brought my pizza home, the pizza was unevenly sauced, skimpily topped, and it was abundantly clear that the dough was not proofed properly at all (and I sure as hell know what a properly proofed pizza is because I was an assistant manager at one from 4 years and have 6 years of experience making pies).  The pan pizza was subsequently soggy with grease rather than awesomely crunchy that the pan pizza should be.I only crave chain pizzas every once and awhile and I sure won't be ordering from this chain again."
49,2,2,Says their open at 11am and not one person is there and the doors are locked... happened 3x to me in the same month...
50,4,1,"Wow a piZza hut! You don't see those around anymore, at least not where I'm from and not attached yto a target or pizza hut!Ordered delivery on a Friday night. Came at a reasonable time after online ordering and amending the order on phone was easy as well.Food came as expected and it was good, the old reliable pizza supreme and the breadsticks. All in all, nostalgia!"
51,2,2,"Front ppl and cook ppl don't  communicate. Their services very bad. Order to carry out at 5:14pm and Im got a pizza at 6:53pm. Fat lady in front don't care, her but is too heavy to go back and check order number. I finally got my one large pizza after 1 and 45mins, I found my pizza is dry and cold. Its been in there and they waited pizza to get cold I guess. Very bad service and they want you to pay first when they dont give estimate time to customer. I would not go back there. Rather go local pizza store who cares about customer since its their buniess. Not smone  works in pizza Hut and get paid by hourly."
52,2,2,"This location is 5 blocks away from me and placing an order at 12:25pm ""estimated"" delivery time was 12:55pm called in at 1:37pm and they said its out for delivery...over 1 hr since order placed never ordering from here again ill order from Papa Johns from now on which I just found out is on 53 Street and 30 Ave..place a delivery order at your own risk..no apology for unacceptable wait for food or anything just ""your order should arrive shortly"" shortly after 1.5hr plus ... horrible get more reliable delivery staff if thats the case"
53,2,2,"Absolutely terrible branch. Tried ordering delivery multiple times, but the pizza was routinely late, cold, and wrong. Once we called for delivery status after an inordinate delay and the woman who answered the phone maniacally laughed about it. Seems there is no management or supervision of the Neanderthals working there."
54,2,2,"If you like undercooked chicken then this place is for you! Pizza is terrible compared to other locations, pizza always seems to be burnt and dry. Whatever you do, avoid the boneless wings at all costs. I've given this place several chances and every time I order the boneless wings they are ALWAYS undercooked. I've complained to them several times about this but nothing is done, therefore I am done with this location."
55,2,2,"The reviews are on point. Just purchased an $11+ pan medium cheese and it was equivalent to a 7-11 pizza that's been sitting under a hot lamp for a few hours. The service was unprofessional and confusing. The small vestibule area was cluttered and customers weren't sure where to order, pick up or even who was next. It's amazing with the consistent poor reviews over the years why corporate hasn't stepped in to save the face of their franchise at this location."
56,2,2,Worst pizza I've ever head. Toppings were uneven and the sauce was watery. Staff were rude.
57,2,3,What kind of Pizza Hut doesn't deliver 1.0 mile away? You have cars...
58,2,2,Ordering from this location is a waste of time and money. They never give the right order and when you call the manager (marie) is not even apologetic about it.
60,4,4,"While I realize that it is a sin to get pizza in NY from some chain restaurant especially with all these small businesses struggling from the pandemic, I was curious to try Pizza Hut's take on Detroit style pizza. All in all, their Detroit style pizza along with their menu items are fairly decent. In terms of corporate pizza, I would put Dominos and Pizza Hut at the top above Papa Johns and Little Caesar's. Obviously, all of the corporate pizza places are a step below any pizzeria place in NYC in the pizza hierarchy. Rambling about pizza quality in NYC aside, the Detroit style pizza is good, not as good as Lion's Tigers and Squares in Chelsea but hey there aren't that many Detroit style pizza places in New York at the moment. I'd recommend giving it a try."
59,4,4,"I have a love hate thing for this type of pizza. Sometimes you don't want real pizza and you want this type of whatever this might be. I'm not knocking it by any means but compared to a real slice of pizza this is just, well, Ehhh. Their wings are ok but over priced IMO. Service here is what you would expect from these chain pizza places."
61,1,4,"I just love Pizza Hut!! Their pizza taste like no other. This Pizza Hut has a parking lot and they take orders from the phone, however they do not deliver which is the downside. I usually get the medium pan with chicken on the cheese pizza. The price is very good as well. You cannot best their crust. Check then out"
62,4,1,"Everywhere I go I feel there is a Domino's or Papa Johns, but it seems Pizza Huts are far and few in between, especially in South Brooklyn.On our way back home from Queens, we were craving Pizza Hut, since we hadn't had it in the longest time, so we stopped by this one in Queens. Being that it was a dine-in location, we felt we would also get better service, even for take-out. We placed our order through their website and rolled in soon after. There was a huge parking lot out front, so rolling in to wait wasn't an issue. We stepped in at around 7pm on a Saturday and the order pick up line was directly to the right of the entrance after walking in. There were a few families dining in, but a lot more people waiting for their orders. It took about another 10 minutes for our order to come out, but everything worked out perfectly. We were able to get our order ""quickly"" and the stuffed crust pizza that we ordered was perfect. There were no issues with the service or the pizza order.Although we finally got our fix on that evening, if we're ever craving Pizza Hut, we now know where to go!"
63,2,4,"Hi There Yelpers, I haven't been to this Pizza Hut in years and finally today 3/6/20 we decided to get a large pie with pineapple, a large pie with pepperoni and an order of 12 honey BQE bone in chicken wings. The food was given to us pretty quickly which I'm always concerned about but since the pizza boxes were hot we just kept on going home, once we got home the cheese on the pizza was dry, the pineapples were minimal, looked and tasted old like it was reheated and waiting there before we even ordered and the same goes for the pepperoni pizza. We ate one slice each and to the garbage it went. The only reason they get two stars in this review is because of the empty and convenient parking lot and because the wings were good. THAT'S IT!!"
64,1,1,How can I not give Pizza Hut 5 stars?!?! Pizza Hut is amazing and always better than dominos
65,1,1,Memories great to be back. Great treat love the service. Deep pan yummy. Great place to visit with family kids loves it. Good service overall will visit again.
66,2,2,"Every time I have ordered anything to go, they have messed it up so royally, I had to ask myself ""did I order ANY of this?"". Sadly, no. I specifically ordered without pepperoni,  but there it is.So, okay, they're eager to put extra stuff I don't want on my take out? You would think they would want to put extra food out at the salad bar, too, right?Nope. Most of the salad bar containers remain empty unless you flag down an employee and point out that they're out of something.  Then, it might get refilled. Might.The lunch buffet is the saddest buffet I have evwr seen. The pizza was dry and had sat there far too long. The breadsticks had no sauce, I asked my waiter twice for some, but he either forgot both times or just didn't care. They never brought out anything new to the buffet in the entire time I was there eating.They'll bring you the wrong drink, and then tell you it's what you ordered. Like, you really don't know what you do and don't drink or eat.As far as ""family friendly"", there are no changing tables in the restroom. So, I guess they expect you to change your kid on the filthy bathroom floor, or the sticky tables where food is served.They also don't deliver. Despite what the TV commercials and website imply.With how dirty the restaurant is, thwy really should encourage delivery as an option."
70,2,4,"How they call this buffalo wings , they look like pigeon wings. Stay with the alright pizza."
71,4,4,"This pizza hut used to be the best spot growing up as a kid,but now I'm older the restaurant looks amazing.No more of the wall that divide seating from salad bar,just wish they made the pizza faster.And the kid at the local middle schools are kinda loud when they come"
72,4,1,"I've been coming to this Pizza Hut since the early 90's. It's a neighborhood staple. They have recently remodeled, as most pizza huts have merged with Wing Street. I prefer any New York mom and pop pizza shop over a chain pizza shop, but the pizza is pretty solid if you're in a pinch."
73,2,2,I been to this location twice and got the same experience.  Very bad management.  The menu is confusing.  The workers are miserable.  Avoid at all cost.  There are many independent pizzerias near by go there.
74,2,2,"Horrible service been waiting over a hour for a plain pie to dine in with, 1 hour 19 mins in and I got my cheesy bread and don't even get me started on how long I waited on drinks like 30 mins for a water and a Pepsi.. really unorganized and staff seem to not even care. My waiter walks as if he has nails under his feet. Never coming back worst Pizza Hut experience."
75,1,4,There aren't many dine-in Pizza Hut restaurants anymore and this is the lat of a dying breed. I love pizza and realistically who doesn't but there's a different taste of having a a fresh Pizza Hut pizza right then and there. Pizza Hut is so much better when it fresh out the oven and not being delivered 45 minutes later. The service was pretty good wish our waiter had a personality instead of a drone.
76,1,1,"I'm very nostalgic as I write this review because this Pizza Hut is more than just a chain pizza place, it is a place that has so many memories of my childhood and happy days. I'm originally from Afghanistan and when we first came to America my family and I weren't very familiar with pizza or American food in general, We ended up coming to Pizza Hut when I was in elementary school because they would give you a small personalized pan pizza if you read a certain amount of books. The pizza was so good that we started coming here when we would have something to celebrate like a birthday or a graduation. This Pizza Hut became the place where my family and I shared every happy event. Years later, we have moved much farther away from this Pizza Hut and even now when my brothers and sisters and I are celebrating monumental life achievements like college graduations, buying of a new home, job promotions, and professional accolades, we never discuss where we will be going - we simply all meet at this Pizza Hut. Go here and start your own family memories and enjoy some good pizza."
77,1,4,I've only eaten at this place 1 time a very long time ago. But I order from here maybe 1-2 times a month. I normally place my order online and take a short drive to pick it up. It's usually ready when I arrive which is great. The food is still hot and nicely packaged. I placed an order this past weekend and the only complaint was the cheesy bread. They were extremely hard and stale. Definitely not freshly made to order. They should consider that more often because nobody likes food that's been sitting out before it gets to you. Overall a great take-out choice.
78,4,2,"The pizza is great but the service was horrible. The assistant manager, Bappy, was very standoff-ish and looked miserable. When I walked in, he didn't even greet me or ask me what I needed help with; he just stared at me with a serious look and when I told him that I was there for a pick-up, he just told me the price without checking to see what it was that I ordered or if it was even ready. He had a bit of an attitude because whenever I talked to him, he would only give me one word answers or not even respond at all. I understand if you're having a bad day or not all too into your job, just please don't take it out on loyal, paying customers please!"
79,2,4,"Hostess attempted to seat us next to two different groups with kids, we politely request to be seated away from the children. She catches an attitude and seats us in a booth away from the party but throws our menu on the table like whatever. Nasty attitude from the get go. Previous yelper was right, they are only nice and give good service to their own, everyone else, later for you. Our server was polite but the food was late and lukewarm."
80,2,2,Horrible service. Great pizza. We were dying for a sitedown pizzahut and was so excited. But the service was so bad! Sat at a dirty table. Waited forever to get pizza and no refills. Just terrible.
68,1,4,"This Pizza Hut is cool simply because it's a dine in Pizza Hut. You have the choice of picking up pizza or dinning in and actually ordering from a lengthy menu. The dining area itself is a nice size. Clean and clean tables as well! Note that the pizzas aren't normal pieced.It seemed to be a bit more expensive and of course there's no ""deals"" or ""coupons"" that you can use when you regularly order pizza. Our experience here was okay. The wait was pretty lengthy however the pizza and the brownie came fresh as can be.Both tasted realllly great! Would definitely make my way around here again if I wanted to spend a little more to dine in and eat my pizza."
82,2,4,"Pizza is my favorite food and Pizza Hut is my favorite pizza.  I have been missing Pizza Hut dearly since moving here from Ohio.  I don't live within delivery range of any Pizza Huts, and personal pan pizzas from KFC/Pizza Hut Express restaurants simply won't cut it for me.  So I made a 40 minute trip (subway and walking) to go to this Pizza Hut.Arrived during dinner rush and it was crowded.  We were seated relatively quickly though.  Drinks arrived within a reasonable time, as did our food.  Food (medium Supreme pizza, medium cheese pizza, and 8 wings) arrived within a reasonable time.  Food was amazing... then again, Pizza Hut is my favorite pizza :)  5 stars for the food.Server was clearly overwhelmed by the amount of tables she had.  Forgot the requested marina sauce, brought out the wrong beverage when she gave us refills.  She was polite but not friendly.  Clearly she was tired, stressed.  Not the biggest deal.Restaurant was dirty as hell.  Our table had crumbs all over it.  I brushed them off with our menus.  Trash all over the floor near surrounding tables.  Trash and plates all over the tables that hadn't been bussed yet.  They clearly need to hire more workers to buss tables, sweep the floor, keep up with restaurant cleanliness so they can turn over tables faster and maintain a sanitary environment.  I wonder how filty the kitchen is 0_o.Next time I decide to make a pilgrimage to Queens to visit a dine-in Pizza Hut, I won't be visiting this location."
83,4,4,"I only review this place because it is one of the few legitimate dine-in Pizza Huts in Queens with wait service.  Many of the others that the website says are ""dine-in"" are just essentially Pizza Hut expresses in a food court.  Wings at pizza hut are actually not bad.  Sriracha honey wings are actually something I would order again.  The pasta on the other hand is on the level of TV-dinner pasta (super soft in the water too long, with sauce)."
84,2,2,"I have been coming here since i was a kid, (i am 32 now) service and quality of the food was much better back then. they are def under new management and ever since it has went downhill. the service is terrible!INCLUDED DONATION in my total withOUT telling me!....i called to order in advance and after i hung up remember i had forgot to add a topping, i realized my total was off so i added my topping and proceeded to question the girl that picked up, she told me how much the tax was, when i told her i was still a dollar over that, she said ""did they ask you if you wanted to donate?"" i said yes and i declined, she said ""oh okay""....i had to ask her...was that included in  my total, she said yes but i took it off with an attitude...yes folks i said attitude. then when my honey picked up the pizza he asked the same girl that picked up the phone about it and she said again with an attitude..""i took it off"" and rolled her eyes. well lets just say my honey let the manager know how he felt about that....lol Its not the point of a dollar, its the point of ....if they do shady stuff like that, makes me wonder where that ""donation"" is really going AND how else are they being shady.....food prep, food storage....def on the food quality because the pizza is okay, not great.i go here because its near by, but wouldn't really be recommending it to anyone."
85,4,2,"I've been coming here since I was a kid. I think I enjoyed it more back then though. We came for my brothers graduation last Friday, terrible idea! There were so many boys and girls coming to celebrate their graduations. We came for the buffet which is ridiculously cheap, I think it's $5.99 for lunch buffet. The buffet basically is a salad bar and a pizza bar that is continuously refilled with if fervent types of pizza. There wasn't a wait because we arrived relatively early. But the service wasn't the best from what I remember. It took almost a half an hour for our drinks to reach the table and forget about a refill! I went to the front and brought my cup because I can't go without water for very long. Generally service is good but they were really busy. If you want unlimited and cheap pizza this is the place to go."
67,2,2,"I hardly ever order from Pizza Hut just because in my area the don't do delivery so I have to order carry out, at least the food came out correct but I ordered the 2 liter soda I told my boyfriend to go pick it up and of course no soda. I call just to get the money refunded for that all they can tell me is that they'll put in a note for my next order. How can I trust them to put in a stupid note if they can't even remember to put the dam soda in the bag! I order maybe 2x every year what the hell makes you think I'm going to order anytime soon"
87,2,4,"Have  been coming to this place since the 90s never had a problem up until Sunday decided to sit and eat in alot of tables were available still had to wait 15 minutes waitress Alexis was the worse took our drinks and food order came back 10  min empty handed to ask us ""what we order again"" she serve a table that came in after us with all their orders  another 5 minutes she came with the drinks then another 15 minutes she came out with the appetizer .If you're Indian you'll be taking care of on time she serve her own kind better."
89,2,4,Writing this comment while I'm sitting here in this Pizza Hut .. This place used to be good n great customer service.. Nat anymore.. So called mr team manager dent listen properly orderd twice still my order came wrong n waited but I had to get up n look for these guys n that young girl uhh forget about customer service she didn't even say hi ..so rude ...seems like new owners family working there n they all want gigle in the kitchen n forgets there's customers outside ... .. Forget this place ..
88,1,1,"Newly renovated, top notch Pizza Hut. These dine-in ones are rare nowadays and this has to rank up there with the best of them now that it has been renovated. Flatscreen TVs, salad/pizza bar and chairs with the Hut logo subtly carved out of the backrest- nice touch Pizza Hut."
86,1,3,"Special deal :the big box dinner which is 2 medium one topping pizzas, one side order(wings, pasta or pizza rollers) and bread/cheese sticks for $22.85 after tax."
91,4,4,"It's not the same as it used to be. The salad bar appears empty most of the time. The place is more crowded during the evening. The pizza is still good, kinda better than dominoes (but that's just my opinion). Buffalo wings and breadsticks are great too. Price-wise, the food is good"
92,4,3,"It's best if you call in advance if your taking the food for takeout. Always busy, no matter what day of the week."
93,2,2,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! This is my first time writing a review, that's how angry I am!!! I wish I could give 0 stars! It has to be new management or something. They totally screwed up my order and then asked me to wait until they corrected it WHICH they then screwed up again!!! The ""manager"" then had the audacity to shout at me ""why didn't you tell me that before"" and slammed my messed up order on the table. Is this how you treat customers??? I think not! I asked for a refund and took my order to another establishment."
94,1,1,"Everytime I come here it's always fast service. Pizza comes comes out fresh and hot to your table. Love the wings here, would come alone just for that If their cheesy crust pizza wasn't so darn good!."
96,2,2,"TRASH!! My husband, myself and our six year old son went here just now and we had to leave! We waited for 30 mins for some bread and wings...bread and wings!! They seemed to be serving everyone BUT us. Disgusting!"
95,4,2,"I've only eaten here once and for good reason. This place has become a running joke to a friend of mine and me. It seemed like every time we asked for something it took 20 mins for it to come. Napkins, straws, another item. It was so funny. I will say that the food here is and has always been prepared well though so take it outBut if you do eat in try to avoid some guy whose name starts with the letter Z."
97,2,2,I wouldn't bring my dog here! Service I'd hit or miss the staff acts like they are doing you a favor by even answering a question filthy disgusting place
98,2,2,How is a pizza place closed on superbowl Sunday? Unbelievable! !!!! They need to be closed for good.
99,2,4,they dont deliver to my apartment. WACKKKK! besides that i guess the food is ok.
69,1,1,Food was awesome and fresh. Our server Babul was the best! He was so attentive and nice. He gave us the special even though is wasn't on the new menu. I'll come back only if he takes care of us. Lol
102,1,1,I haven't even tried the food yet but Quantel made my whole night so much better by her sheer kindness and passion for humanity. She is truly an incredible employee and she helped turn my whole night around when another older employee had told me to leave. Thank you Quantel
101,2,3,"Go here if you like ghetto bums bugging you for stuff at all angles.  If you get lucky, they'll even help themselves to some of your food!"
103,1,4,"Of course there are better places to get pizza in NYC -- duh! But since I grew up on Pizza Hut, I get a craving for it now and then. And as this spot is close to my job, I've no problem stopping by for a pie. Now, is this place ridiculously expensive? Of course it is. It's a stone's throw away from Times Square. Is the staff rude? Nope. Not all all. Is this place dirty? Given its location, I'd say no. Look, when I come here, I know what I'm getting into. And I ain't about to complain."
81,2,2,"Filthy. Bad customer service, and oh let's not forget the flies that decide to buzz around when you're eating.  Gross."
105,2,2,"The worst things about this KFC are the prices, and the rude sales associates/cashiers. You can pay $9 for a two piece grilled combo! This is without a drink. Add a drink, and it brings your total to about $11.25. For this price, you can just walk a couple steps over and eat at the Applebee's next door, where instead of taking a tray of food from a rude teenage cashier, you can at least have the rude teenager bring the food to you.The Pizza Hut isn't much better. The prices are outrageous, and the pizzas have either been sitting out for a long time, or poorly cooked, or both (I KNOW!). It's okay, because my red hot anger usually melts the cheese on top just fine.My friend and I jokingly refer to this KFC as 'The Dungeon', because the main seating area is located underground(no windows). We also call it The Dungeon because it's absolutely a disgusting place to have to sit and enjoy a meal. They recently renovated the area, but it still has a sour smell. Since there are no windows, there is no ventilation, and the smell of sour mop usually permeates the whole space.  It smells like a porn shop (sperm and ammonia)...not that I know what that smells like, it's just what I've heard.The seating is cramped and uncomfortable. You may literally be sitting right next to that loud group of Spanish tourists who just won't shut the (expletive) up!  Cayate por favor! But yes, the seats are too close together.Many of the tables are wobbly and many broken underneath. Overall not a great space to eat.Overall this is a place you go only if you are desperate and don't have time to walk somewhere else. It's really expensive, so you may have to choose between that movie and a two piece box meal. Bon Apetit!"
106,2,2,"My friends and I were recently talking about the worst pizza you can get in NY, and Pizza Hut came up. Since we are dumb, we decided to come here and give it a shot to see if it is truly the worst pizza in all the land. It is. The worst part? A plain pie costs about $18 for a size that is nearly half of what you can buy at a hole-in-the-wall place (for a whole lot cheaper, too). The crust has a faint taste of freezer burn, making me wonder how long these things were frozen before being heated up again. And this location is so dirty that I'm confident there are 100s of rat and cockroach residents in the basement.Awful. Just.... don't. I'm ashamed of myself."
104,2,2,"This place sucks! It was extremely cold! Took forever to finally get our food. The food was not good either in my opinion. There is a reason why they have just one space heater in this place, two people working, and it looks vacant!  Do not come here!!! What a waste of money and TIMEEEE !"
90,2,4,"As far as I know, this is the only eat-in Pizza Hut left. The dining room is kindof dirty though. Last two times I went, our server either had an attitude, or didnt know very much english. However, i don't come here for the service, I come for the pizza, which this location manages to not mess up. If you want to enjoy the pizza, without the questionable service/atmosphere, there's always takeout."
100,2,4,"Came in here only because I had a business call to take and needed some quiet space. Since the little one was with me, I went on ahead and ordered a kid's meal which consisted of a personal pan pizza and a drink. The cashier was nice. The place was clean. Ample seating downstairs and for the location being in Midtown it wasn't too crowded. Now I can imagine why lol.The pizza...well, I grew up eating Pizza Hut and was pretty disappointed. I thought it was pretty funny that I was longing for the 2 Bros dollar pizza in Chelsea. Eating this Pizza Hut pizza just made me hungrier. How is that even possible lol?!"
107,2,2,"Wanted to try the Boneless (I ATE The Bones!!!) type chicken as I'm an Avid KFC, KGC & you name it, most of my life, but this was another ridiculously bad experience at THIS location!!!My GF hesitated to eat any of it because she couldn't even tell if the White Meat was really white meat (she doesn't like dark meat chicken) and I agreed.  We cut a piece in half and then dissected it because it still  had sections that looked exactly like the DARK meat chicken that I love.. I was thankful cuz ""there's more for me"" until I started eating...It's like they added twice the seasoning & salt to the mix.  Very peppery/spicy but that was ""bearable"" until I realized how salty it was, too.  I could not satiate my thirst, woke up in the middle of the night HUGELY parched and got up to drink a HUGE glass of water when I got up.The service is usually bad, but this occasion made it ALL BAD.  Not a worthwhile experience at all.Wish I could give it a ZERO!"
108,2,2,"This is definitely the worst Pizza Hut ever.  I am really surprised that the Pizza Hut  Corporation has not intervene with this location especially since it is in such a heavily tourism area.I went to this particular location twice.  Two years apart and neither time was I able to eat my meal   Don't get me wrong, I love love love Pizza Hut.The last time I went to this particular Pizza Hut, I just ordered a Diet coke  and an order of bread sticks.  The breadsticks were very hard that I could not even bite it.  The first breadsticks literally made a snapping sound when I. broke it.I tried to eat the breadsticks.  I dunked the bread stick into the sauce that they gave me.  I thought the sauce was nice and warm, maybe I can try to eat these.  Well  I couldn't    The breadsticks were really hard as rocks.I took my order up to the cashier.  I apologized for being a pest.  I explained what was wrong with my order.  The cashier was nice and took them.  She told me to wait a minute.  She gave me what I thought was a new order. I sat down with my warm breadsticks.  Pulled one out.  It was broken. It was the same breadsticks.  They were warm BUT they were harder then rocks.  I made a joke and took out a unbroken breadstick and was more or less playing the drums off the table So, I threw the breadsticks away and left.Also this location is not really that clean.  Again I don't understand how the corporate allows this to go on   I understand that this location may be a franchise (but I don't know), but this location is giving the Pizza Hut a bad name"
109,2,2,This KFC has very poor sanitation. The garbage areas are filthy and unkept. They are overflowing and spilling with so much waste left by the customers here and the workers don't do anything about it.
110,1,1,"Stopped by to redeem a birthday treat. Ordered the cinnamon sticks online, & headed over. Staff was nice, a short wait, & I was out the door. My only complaint was that the place could use a renovation. Was pleasantly surprized at how good the sticks were. There were 10 pieces per order. Light & fluffy, inside, crispy, outside, with cinnamon on top. The dipping sauce was addictive, & sweet. I'd actually be inclined to order this again."
111,2,2,Pizza is not good and delivery is very slow and late. They don't even give update have to wait long time on hold. will never order from here again.
112,2,4,Over 90 minutes for an order (45 minutes late) with an order delivered by doordash. Understandably it's not the restaurants fault but nobody would take responsibility after delivery charge and gratuity. Rethink your purchase and buy local.
113,2,2,The snow fell and stopped but they did not shovel all of it and it's cause walking traffic and possible falls by the heavy traffic in front of bus stop...
114,2,2,Ordered for pickup... still had to wait over 15 min!  Why? Very slow service...go buy pizza elsewhere!
115,2,2,The absolute worst service ever I don't really know why I make the mistake and order from this place. One time my order came wrong and I had to wait 45 mins for them to come back and deliver my right order and this time I ordered online and put specially for delivery at 7:45pm and it's 8:30 AND I'm fasting and I canceled the order because it's not here yet. The girl who picked up was extremely rude. This deserved ZERO stars I'm ashamed to even give you guys one star. Never again!!!!
117,2,2,"It was the night before Christmas... we called this Pizza Hut location and a lady picked up and said ""Hi, this is Pizza Hut, we are closed right now. HOW CAN I HELP YOU?"" Lmao what?? If you're closed why would you ask a dumb question like that... and my high school cousin was flustered and didn't know how to respond because of the dumb question asked by the lady working, so my cousin asked when are you opened? Which was wrong on my cousin's part but the lady responded aggressively saying ""WE ARE CLOSED"" and continued to say ""how about I get your number and call you continuously throughout the night and bother you."" I don't know who she is but she was extremely rude and aggressive. So unnecessary. This happened at 8:30pm on December 24th, 2020. So whomever was working at that time needs an attitude check and get a different job that doesn't require working with people. No need to be rude and please think before you ask ""how can I help you"" if you're closed. Not going to order pizza from this location ever again."
116,1,1,Before I used to order dominoes but now I order pizza hut and it's worth it they're pizza is the best the cheese is delicious and I recommend renember god loves you
118,2,2,Worst pizza possible. Rather get little Cesars pizza than this garbage. And so expensive. These people don't care about the pizza lol
119,2,2,Became very ill after consuming the pizza from here. Be warned. I'm can not pinpoint the exact ingredient that made me ill but everyone that ate it got the stomach bug.
120,4,4,"This isn't the best place to get your Pizza Hut fix, but it's also not the worst. The restaurant itself is, to put it nicely, lackluster. But I do appreciate that there are a handful of tables to sit at. So much more could obviously be done in this location (new wallpaper, better seating arrangement) but its pretty clear they don't care, because its been that way for years.The pizza itself is Pizza Hut pizza. No complaints there. I do really wish that since people do go to this location to sit in house and eat- they should offer a combo meal for the personal pies. Buying the pizza, bread sticks, and soda separately is about $9. However, you do get a full pack of bread sticks much better suited for sharing than the gorging I do.My only real complaint is the continuous flow of non-customers using the bathroom. I've never been in there and I never will considering that!"
121,2,2,"As a big fan of Pizza hut it stinks that I have to write this review. This pizza hut might be the worst in the country!!!! First the inside of this restaurant.. and calling it a restaurant is quite a stretch. There is like 5 tables and they are filthy. I do not feel like it asking a lot to just wipe down a table once and a while. Second the delivery zone is miniscule. I live 2 miles from this place and they refuse to deliver, but the dominos next door does. Third the douches that answer the phone have no idea what customer service is. The conversation went like this: "" Can I have extra blue cheese with my wings"" and he responds "" nah"". I said ""I do not mind paying extra"" he responds I said no right , you want the damn pizza or not?"".  "" Uh I ordered wings dude"", he hangs up on me, but not before he makes some racist comments. Fourth the pizza is miserable. Its very simple the damn instructions of pizza making is right in front of you, however these geniuses find a way to destroy everything Pizza hut stands for. The pizza terrible, barely any sauce, there barely is any cheese. T he crust is dripping with some kind of ""pam -like spray"", it truly is disgusting. This place sucks!!! Please owners if you read this bring the citizens of forest hills a decent pizza hut... not even a good one, but this travesty will not do."
122,2,1,I had pizza from here years ago and it was not bad. However I live in Rego Park and they don't deliver to my neighborhood. What gives? The Dominos down the block from this Pizza Hut delivers to me. Hopefully I'll get an answer from someone at Pizza Hut.
123,2,2,Ick. Makes me sick.... literally.  Why get nasty franchise pizza when NYC has REAL pizza all over the place???
124,2,4,pizza did not taste great and the doe was not the original i was use to. i think its just rego that does make it the great.
125,4,4,"I have a love hate thing for this type of pizza. Sometimes you don't want real pizza and you want this type of whatever this might be. I'm not knocking it by any means but compared to a real slice of pizza this is just, well, Ehhh. Their wings are ok but over priced IMO. Service here is what you would expect from these chain pizza places."
126,2,4,"Ehhh I usually order for delivery, but for some reason it always takes them more than an hr to deliver a pizza and some wings and by the time it gets to me its already cold. I rather go to a supermarket and by a frozen pizza and throw it into my oven, i think it would cook faster by the time they get here. Atleast ill know my pizza won't be cold."
128,2,2,Absolutely horrible pizza. It took over an hour and a half to receive two medium pies and they tasted like cardboard. Ellios tastes better. I will never order from here again.
129,2,2,Tried pizza hut twice at this place and I must say this is the worst pizza  I have tasted.  ICK
127,2,2,"worst store in the world ever!!!!bad service, even the worst manager in the world ever!don't order it because it's going to waste your time and money!!"
131,2,2,Would give a zero star ....Elizabeth is the worst ...unprofessional and on personal calls ...didn't get my order on the apps ...when I show her the confirmation email ...she put a face to talk on her phone I would never go back there again
130,4,2,"Don't bother. Ordered an hour and half ago, called twice, and found out the driver tried to deliver to the ""wrong house"" but they didn't give me a call to ask where I was. They asked if I wanted them to send the pizza out again and I told them no thanks because it's been an hour and half in 98 degree weather so it's definitely no good.Update: Irvin the GM called me back immediately to rectify the situation and sent me a fresh order free of charge. I definitely appreciate the gesture but would've been nice if they got it right the first time."
132,2,4,"Did they photoshop my pizza? My pizza just look like the online illustration. Props for making it artifically visual appealing. That was the only thing that i was impressed with. As usual, everybody who ate pizza hut knows this that it goes down hill from here.pizza hut was the only pizza shop near the area. Flushing needs new pizza shops. Any recommendations?I ordered the meatball/ spinach and sausage/pepper pizzas. I was disappointed by the sausage/pepper as the toppings werent as noticeable. meatball and spinach were decent and workable toppings in the future. Now to the cheese and sause, both were lacking any substance. Waiting for the day when a company can deliever high quality pizza."
133,2,2,"I was really disappointed with my experience here last night.My brother and I were picking up food for my family on the way home and we decided to get pizza. Since we were thinking about what to get on the way, we didn't order ahead. We parked in front of the Pizza Hut at 8:00 and placed our order. We hung out in the car for about half an hour since it was supposedly going to take about 20-30 minutes to prepare our order (two medium two-topping pizzas and one large two-topping pizza). Plus, we had prime parking there so we weren't going to leave that spot open!So we went into the restaurant at 8:30ish and we asked about our order. The girl we spoke to said that it wasn't ready and that it would be ready in ""five to seven minutes"" (that's exactly what she said). Fine. We sat down and waited... and waited... and waited. I guess we must have been immersed in our phones or something because it was 9:11 and so we went to the counter again and asked another lady who may have been the previous girl's boss or manager or something (she was explaining how to do something to the first girl for the customer before us). We were getting really hungry and annoyed so I told her we've been waiting almost an hour for our food. That's when she went to the delivery pouches and pulled out our pizzas and said ""They JUST came out."" That's all she said. Not an apology for the pizza taking so long or the fact that the pizzas were just sitting in the delivery pouch - it was one of those two things, and she didn't acknowledge it. All she said to us was ""They JUST came out.""I get that the place was probably busy with incoming orders on a Sunday night (quite possibly a lot of people getting food for watching football) but don't have one girl tell me that it will be ""five to seven minutes"" and then make us wait *40 MINUTES* for the order, and then have the nerve to say ""They JUST came out."" Totally unprofessional and it really made me not want to come back here, which is a shame since I love Pizza Hut and I usually like this location."
134,2,2,"Terrible takeout experience. Came here to take advantage of the $5 promotion but the staff was very dishonest. Ordered two one-topping pan pizzas, light on the sauce. Hardly any foot traffic but they took nearly 30 minutes to complete my order. One employee was too preoccupied with her phone to attend to any of the customers. When the pizzas were finally done I was quick to check that they got my order right. Guess what? No!Instead of pan pizza they gave me hand-tossed. I'm not a fan of hand tossed. When I told the person at the counter she responded that the promotion only was for hand tossed. How come you didn't mention that when I placed my order?A few days later, out of curiosity, I checked out the Pizza Hut website. And behold, customer got to choose whether they wanted pan or hand tossed and the price was the same. I would have had no problem if the staff was simply upfront about their mistake. But I don't like being fed lies."
135,1,4,"Oops I checked into the wrong address because the other one showed up first. This location has only 3 tables and some people like to take over the space and not caring that they do. Even though my bus passed through here like a millionth times, I finally went in today and I spotted those adorable personal pan pizza. I ordered a Specialty ($5.99 + tax) of Meat Lover because I am a super carnivore. The crust is crunchy and the pizza is thick and each bite made me oh wow, oh wow ""mama love meat""!"
136,2,2,"My worst pizza experience in my life!!Stay away from their shitty hidden fees.I saw an ad where it said large pizza for $17.99 , but when I order 1 large pizza with 2 liter Pepsi I was charged $28.** 1)$1 extra hidden charge for ordering in menu2) $4 delivery charge that is outside of deliever tip3)tax4)they promise 45 minutes but took 1hour and 45 minutes to come (I ordered at 6pm, came at 7:45pm)5)deliver brought me 16oz bottle instead of 2 liter I order, also the recipe was changed from $28 something to $27 something. 6)delivery girl didnt even gave me the change,or even ask  she just kept it for her tip wtf was that?7)last but most importortantly the pizza was shit. Cheese was super extra thin while the bread was super thick. 1 to 7 ratio. Stay away.. I will never ever order again from pizza hut overall. Order at papa johns or just regular italian style pizzaria"
137,2,2,"Do not order from this place! They will charge you for all the extras and not add them! Then they tell you that you have to drive back to them and bring them the crust for a 9$ refund even though they charged you 13$ for the pie! By manager Sarah's admission it is Pizza Hut policy that if they screw up your order then the customer has to come in and basically pay for the mistake because she has no proof of the things that are being said! Well Sarah here is the proof of crust without the fiery red pepper crust and burnt jalapeños! This is 2015 and I do not need to drive 20 mins there and then back just because your rude self can't admit a mistake! I would give them a glowering middle finger if that was an option on Yelp! Yelpers unite to teach these crude and rude people a lesson, do not get your pie fix from these trolls!"
138,2,2,"Going on 2 hours waiting for my food. Delivery driver had a flat on the way to us, didn't notify the store to let us know the delivery will be late. Lets see how long it takes.Update:Cancelled my order and asked for a refund, can't get refunded until tomorrow and I have to call back for it. Never again. This isn't the first time this happened either and I still decided to order."
139,1,1,"Wow! Best way to describe my visit there. Came with my girlfriend to dine in and was met with exceptional service and care by one of their employees. I didn't catch her name but she was fantastic. Did everything from taking our order to make sure we had plates, napkins and utensils. Probably one of the best service ever received and we've been too many restaurants. They could all learn from this young lady. We even tipped her at the end after we finished our meal. Pizza and pasta were fresh and tasted so good! The pizza had the perfect combination of soft and crispy. Pasta was so delicious. My girlfriend loved it! Definitely be back to this location!"
144,4,4,"let me just start by saying i secretly love pizza hut. it's one of these extended-family childhood traditions because when we all got together, grammama ONLY liked pizza hut and their pan crispy crust. so when the fams got together once a month, we all laid out in this dramatic long table and chowed down. so yes, my childhood memory-brain worships pizza hut.fast foward to adulthood. ordered some mediums and it was ALL dough, NO cheese, SCANTY toppings. absolutely pathetic :( the breadsticks were stale and i have to pay for my extra marinara (i eat the crust like breadsticks and dip, try it, you'll thank me).that said, delivery was superquick (weekday 3pm-ish order, was here, 5 min from location in less than 30 minutes). happy with service, but perhaps pizza hut in general is dulling its shiny red hat..... sad face :("
140,1,3,I grew up on PizzaHut. Who doesn't think PH has great pizza?
141,1,4,"I ordered online for carryout since this pizza hut doesn't deliver to my part of town. I ordered a large pizza with three toppings, breadsticks, and a 2 liter of soda and it was the 15 dollars deal of the day. When I ordered online it said it will be ready in 15mins so by the time I drove out to ph it was ready. I was surprised how on time this pizza hut was with my order. They got my order right and the pizza was delicious of course. Oh and ph breadsticks with the sauce is just as amazing. This isn't the first time I ordered pizza from this pizza hut but so far it has been a good experience. If only they deliver to my part of town then it would be awesome."
143,1,1,"Food tastes and services is really good. I got my food faster then I though. All employees are good, and nice. Love u all."
145,2,2,So I ordered a cheese pizza and not only did I wait an hour but when the pizza got here it was COLD! My girlfriend had a slice and she kept complaining so I decided to call. I was told thin and crispy pizza drys out easy like are u serious I've ordered pizza a thousand times and there's no reason the cheese on my pizza should be cold they are 5mins away from Me and I waited an HOUR !!!!! Do not order from this location !!!!!! I should have listened to the previous reviews!!! Ugh
142,2,2,This place has the worst customer service... you cant expect much from this location bc it's always busy but it doesn't make sense that 1 pie is here after an hr and 15 min... !!!!! The nerve of the delivery guy asking me to come out across the st too. It's a freaking 2 min car ride!
146,2,2,They took 2 hours- I am never ordering delivery from them ever again! Worst Pizza Hut ever
147,2,2,An hour delivery and Horrible pizza! Tasted salty and the meat was definitely not fresh. I ended up tossing away all the topping because of how gross it tasted like! Will not order from here ever again. Now I just hate myself for not ordering from dominos.
148,2,2,Ordered online and time of arrival was 2:03. At 2:15 I called and the girl said the driver left 15 minutes ago..he should be there any minute. Pizza came 30 minutes late.. Burned at the top and soggy oily at the bottom.  If I wanted to cause drama I wouldn't have paid..and slammed the door in his face..  Horrible service..horrible pizza.
149,2,4,"Had a medium supreme pizza. Tasted really salty and similar to frozen microwave pizza. Actually frozen pizza could've tasted better. Im giving an extra star only because of fast delivery. Actually came in20mins, but i live 2 blocks away and most huts do not deliver."
150,1,2,"Universal pizza hut taste!  I miss upstate.  I miss my family.  I hate school.  I hate this sales guy at the union sq Best Buy. I really need a laptop by Tues but I just cant buy one from a jerk.I wanna run away and become a flight attendant and make my friend Joann become one too.  Dance class was just ok today.  The moves were fly but the  class concentration was off.  I got really hungry afterwards tho.  Probly cuz it was a special twerkshop that served wine but most likely from my yelp directory search for a nonexistant Staples Office Supply store within Penn Station. Thanks for playing me Yelp editors.  Get it togetha.  Please.  My only solace was spotting this Pizza Hut Express amidst all the train travelers.  Aight yeah why not?  Im going in.  Yes i grew up on pizza hut.  Yes i like Detroit style pizza.  Yes i know they're really from Kansas.  The counter guy was retarded.  Yes.  Yet the personal pan, hawaiian style was fresh, comforting and filled my void of hunger and of other lonely parts within my body*.*not referring to the putang"
151,2,2,"Pizza Hut is my favorite pizza, so it hurts to have to give this location 1 star. I've been here twice and both times there was nobody at the register. I had to wait for an employee to come out the kitchen. On my first visit I did receive a freshly cooked meat lovers personal pan pizza after the wait. On my second visit right after the employee announced he would be out in a minute I noticed another unexpected visitor was also waiting for pizza.  A big roach was slowly walking around on the counter, very comfortable, like he was waiting for his order. I had to get out of there after seeing that. I couldn't stomach waiting for my pizza with a roach. Eat here at your own risk!"
152,1,2,"Pizza Hut, more like Pizza Butt. I'm tired of their circle pizzas. Why do they all have to be circles? Give me a square pizza any day of the week over a dumb circle pizza. Wasn't impressed with all the cheese and sauce either. No cheese or sauce next time please."
154,4,4,"This place is nothing more than average.  The prices are very high, but considering it's in a food court in Penn Station in the middle of NYC, I guess that's to be expected.  Personal pan pizzas were around $6 each, and they are the size of a frozen microwavable pizza.  I'm not sure how this setup works, but when I ordered our pizzas, the cashier walked over to KFC, went into the kitchen area, and walked back out with two boxes containing hot, personal pan pizzas.  The cashier seemed somewhat distant, and when we asked him for forks (the pizza was very soggy and not cut all the way through), he seemed to get annoyed.  The pizzas had an obscene amount of grease.  The selection here was minimal, almost zero.  All they really offer here are personal pan pizzas and some sort of sticks."
153,4,4,"Decently good pizza at a decent price.  The cheese tasted cheap, but you get what you pay for."
155,2,2,"DON'T EAT HERE!!!!  Never again.  I don't typically write reviews, but this experience was so horrifying I figured I had to share.I had been here a couple of times before and was willing to over look the grungy and greasy exterior, and the fact that the food was only ever luke warm at best.  Since it is in the middle of Penn Station and the cashier was always offering to pop my food back in the oven for a few minutes to reheat it, I believe my low expectations were in line with what one should expect.Not this time.  I ordered bread sticks and a personal pan pizza.  To my dismay, the bread sticks were over cooked but enjoyable enough.  However, when I pulled apart the slices of my pizza, I found not one, but multiple strands of hair threaded in the middle of the pizza throughout the cheese in each slice of the pizza.  It was as if someone had combed their hair with their hand and then stuck their hand in the cheese before they sprinkled it over my pizza.This is totally and inexplicably unacceptable, and downright disgusting.  I love Pizza Hut's pizza, but I will never, ever eat here again."
156,4,4,The service was friendly. The pizza cheese quality was OK. However the onion in the pizza was cut in big pieces and that wasn't really cool :-( In general it was a good experience for somebody who is eating pizza from time to time.
158,2,2,"Save your money and go somewhere else. I used to come here to get taco bell a long time ago and it was okay. Today I went to pick up a large pizza for my grandmother. I even called twice to confirm the order. But when I get there, I get a medium pizza with skimpy amounts of ingredients. I explained that this was the wrong order and that I had spoken to someone on the phone and was told that the person wasn't even there. Apparently they don't even take orders at this location So I was stuck with this ""medium"" pizza for $14.14 what a waste of money"
157,4,3,Me & My Friends came here one at this Pizza Hut I had the Pepperoni pizza it was ok...
160,1,1,"I don't know bout everybody else but I never had a problem with them always deliver on time food still hot, always get the 10$ dinner box. Great"
159,1,1,This place generally I don't know about.But pizza hut has the best and my most favorite pizza in the world it is completely amazing.You have to go here.
161,2,2,"My food was left on the concrete floor, in a clear garbage bag, on the corner. Not even in front of my door. When I called to find out where my pizza was, I was told it was ""left on the porch"" I don't have a porch... My pizza is currently sweating"
162,2,2,"I have travelled 30 minutes to this location twice. If I go here again, it will be an accident. I have no problem paying extra for extra cheese, but if there was any extra cheese, it was negligible at best. I got stuffed crust also. They didn't put the butter flavor on the crust. Again, I don't mind paying extra, if at least I am getting what I'm paying for."
163,2,2,Worst pizza hut I've ever ordered from. Which is unfortunate because i love the hut and hate other places such as dominos or cici's pizza. I live exactly a block and a half away so theres no reason my breadsticks should come so hard they're basically long croutons at this point. Marinara sauce felt like it just came out of the fridge. The pizza itself was so cold it wasn't worth eating. I give places second chances and i did the same with this place. Same situation different days. I will never be ordering from them again. Don't waste your money there are plenty of local pizza shops willing to deliver pizza thats hot and ready to be eaten at a better price.
164,2,2,"Horrible. I ordered Pizza at 4pm time now is 6:26 pm and still haven't received the right pizza. I called and ask what's taking so long the manager stated the driver was in an accident sorry for the delay..... the driver gets here I asked him was he ok from the accident he said ""What Accident"" which mean the manager lied. Currently waiting for my pizz"
165,2,2,Terrible service. Placed an online order 40 mins prior to arriving for pick-up (even though It said it would be ready in 10-20 mins). Not only was our order not ready but they claimed to only have received half our order. The worker there was clueless and they're understaffed. Be sure to place an order an hour or so before you plan on picking up.
166,2,2,My pizza is cold. They forgot one of the pizzas that I paid for. They were extremely nonchalant and unapologetic about it. Bumbling idiots. Won't last long here with this type of service. I'm never wrong about these things.
167,2,2,"I placed a very small order midday and expected a bit of a wait but after an hour and a half my food still hadn't shown up.  I contacted the store only to be told the delivery guy should be coming in a few minutes since I only live 5 minutes away I figured I'd be getting the delivery shortly fast forward another half an hour I call back the store for another update to be told by Kevin (if that's even really his name) that the delivery guy came to my home and couldn't find it.  I live on a very accessible block and have never had any issue with food or package deliveries plus the driver never even tried to call. ""Kevin"" didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. Worst experience ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Update****I never got my food and it took 3 months to get my money back had to get my bank involved.DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!"
168,2,1,"It's not my first time here, but it's a big difference between Brooklyn and Long Iand. Okay they are more friendlier I. Long Island they are willing to help you with questions. This guy just nodded, dry eyes and dry face. And trust me I do reverse psychology by killing ppl with kindness. With people who just doesn't have good customer service it don't grace the situation. Pizza was good though, I wish they deliver because my friend lives right down the block. Anyway pls smile next time."
169,2,4,"This place is foul when it comes to delivery, my review and that one star is based strictly on my delivery experience. So it was Sunday around 3pm and I usually get dominos because of the wings but I decided to get Pizza Hut because my fiancé loves it. We order around 3:30 and and the two pies didn't come to us until 5pm they were cold!!! Breadsticks were trash never again."
170,2,2,Abysmal service that's impossible to avoid. The employees seem miserable and ready to leave.  Receiving a greeting is impossible. I would recommend avoiding this particular Pizza Hut if possible. There is a Dominos near by where the customer service is 5stars by comparison.
171,2,2,Very disappointing service.... My order was placed online (where they can literally READ it) and they still messed it up. Like really ? They employees seem bothered by anything you say to them. They carry looks on their faces that make one feel bad about interrupting them. I mean who is the customer here ? Who's paying for the service ? I'm sorry but as a corporation Pizza Hut has got to do better. With the amount of unemployment in the Bronx I'm sure they can find replacements for this lackluster bunch they currently have managing this lovation
172,2,2,I placed an order online processed payment with my credit card. Everything was good got confirmation by email that everything was paid food was on the way. My food comes the driver doesn't get out of the car. I walk to the car asked why didnt you come to the door she said its curb side service take it up with corporate. Then she said you have a balance please pay 31.01. I showed her my email confirmation that it was paid in full. Her response was to pay or I'm taking it back the food.  So I paid the cash instead of sending it back. Just because I didnt want to wait again for the food.  I call the office the manager by the name of ashely told me to bring a copy of my confirmation of payment.  I told her why would I come there if i paid to get food delivered. I asked for a business email pr fax I can send confirmation. She on to say they dont have one then she says I have a business phone send it to that.  No problem  I send it she told me to dispute it with my bank. So they know they just stole my money when they have a pizza hut confirmation that.
173,2,2,SAVE YOUR $$$$$ They should close this location down. They SUCK!!!!!!!! Starting from the Manager. That's the first person I will fire you for a run in this establishment the way it is I placed an order for two pies online at 7:05. They emailed me that my order was ready at 7:21. I got there by 7:20 and nothing was ready. I waited until 7:40 & nothing. Had to argue with the manager to get my 40 bucks back worse place EVER!!!!!   I'm contacting Pizza Hut personally go to Little Caesars much better and less frustrating.
174,2,2,"601 Westchester AvenueBronx, NY 10455 (718) 585-1401I will NEVER order from here!! The people that work there barley have any respect. The place looks dirty."
175,1,1,Very efficient and great service I want to add something different and they help me with it
176,2,2,"horrible service, order never delivered and after 2 weeks money has not been returned. Always placed on hold when calling, in one instance the manager said he was too busy and for me to call back tomorrow. lol."
177,2,2,"I HATED THE FACT I HAVE TO LIE & GIVE THIS PLACE A DAMN STAR!!!!!! Let me start by saying I Love Pizza Hut but, there isn't anything nice I could said about this one it is ABSOLUTELY THE WORST ONE IN THE BRONX!!!!! My husband place an order today at 7:05pm online as a carry out when he received the email that our order will be ready at 7:21 so he got there at 7:20pm to only be told 7 minutes No problem but, that wasn't true because here it is 7:47pm & still No Pizza!!!!!! The manger told my husband 7 more minutes meanwhile delivery driver's was coming in & out picking up Orders. My husband was Super Upset  ask for his money back the manger told him ONCE AGAIN 7 MORE MINUTES!!!!!! But Enough was Enough!!!!! We decided to NOT WAIT ANYMORE WE GOT OUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PLACING A ORDER CAUSE YOU'LL BE WAITING FOREVER FOR NOTHING!!!!!"
179,2,2,If I could give them a negative number I would. I ordered a few things yesterday and it took almost 2 hours. I'm not even complaining about that disgusting time but the fact that the delivery driver tried to start a fight with my boyfriend. Who does that? Horrible establishment.
178,2,2,This location is disgusting!!! The pizza crust looked old and stale. Delivery came in 20 minutes but the food was cold!! I've ordered from this location a few times before and the food never looked like the way it did today! Never ordering from this location again
180,1,1,"Mon-Fri, 11am-1:30pm, are there Lunch buffet hours. That is the only time I actually will go to Pizza Hut. Their food is good, but be prepared for greasy. Of course if you're a, Pizza Hut fan, you know that their pan pizzas are famous and are always greasy, so in other words you should know what you're getting and not complain about it. So yes, buffet hours are somewhat slim, and therefore hard to catch. But if you do, you will enjoy it. They serve 12 different pizzas I believe and is on a rotation. So once one pizza is gone, the next one in line comes, etc. They have 6-7 pizzas on deckdeck at all times, 2 bread stick varieties (cinammon and desert (garlic)). They also serve pasta and separate marianara for the bread sticks. When you come in for a buffet you will be seated almost instant. I usually go alone, so its even faster than if you arrive in a group. Upon seating they will almost instant ask you dfor a drink. Buyer beware, that drink is NOT included in your buffet deal. In fact the drink itself cost 1.99$ but luckily its unlimited refills. They carry Pepsi sodas, and yes, Dr. Pepper as well. A buffet with a drink costs 8.78$ before taxes and tips. My only 2 complaints are that: 1) the marinara sauce is often neglected and not refilled. 2) all 3 times I've been there this month, there is only one person waiting the tables and therefore if you want service it can be awhile. Even if one of the other employees sees you need help, they will just look down at the floor. I understand that may not be your job, but already notify the person who's job it is.Food I enjoy. I mean, I haven't been to a Pizza Hut buffet since the 90s. But its nice once in awhile.Oh yeah, and another thing. This pizza hut buffet only has a pizza bar. There is no salad bar!!!!Anyways, I will rate them a 4. Since their product is always perfect. Service may not be, but let's be honest, most people will usually go back if their food excels."
181,2,2,"Got the epic dinner box a couple of days ago for my family because the Burger King was closed. It was an unholy combination of microwaved pasta, barely cheesy cheese sticks and cardboard tasting pizza with barely any sauce or cheese. They even forgot to include the Marinara sauce for sticks which could have been their only chance of being edible."
182,2,4,"Walked in and asked to be seated, no one eating at all. Guy working said he was the only one there and we could order pizza, but not have it served to us. We could sit in the resturant and eat it, but would have to walk to the counter and get it when it was ready. They don't have a salad bar. He said they do pizza buffet during the week. Needless to say, we left."
183,2,2,"Sooo I just ordered the veggie pizza. HAND TOSSED, no cheese. . Now I know having no cheese on there isn't the reason for my pizza to look like this. I called the store, some smart mouth girl (working Feb 14th at 10:30pm) answers the phone. I tell her that I'm not happy with my pizza and that it's extremely flat and taste like cardboard ..She goes on to tell me that that's what I ordered and she don't know what to tell me.. I said ""hmm.. so what you gave me was hand tossed?! And I'm telling you I'm not satisfied and you tell me ""you don't know what to tell me"" ... okay. I said I'll call back when a manager is there to voice my concerns. She tells me ""well he's gonna say the same thing I said"" ... I said ""so he's gonna tell me, after I show him pictures of my tasteless ""handtossed"" pizza,.. that he don't know what to tell me"" ... okay we'll see. I honestly just wasted my money and I'm piseed. Oh I will be calling back until the issue is resolved."
184,2,2,"Do not go here. We wanted to change our order from take out to eat in. He went to ask, came back and said, ""no, you can't have it here--it was ordered for take out."" So I canceled the rest of the order (cheese sticks and drinks) and just paid for the pizza. I told the manager I was disappointed we couldn't eat there. He then told me, ""oh you can eat here, you would just lose the promotion."" He then told me how much it would be without promotion...not a problem, $5 more. The problem was with the inconsistencies of the waiter and the manager and what they told me."
185,2,4,"Why is this place still open? The resurant and restrooms were discusting. The server had one table, us! Upon arriving we were told to find a clean table, huh! Service was not bad, the server was friendly, its not her fault the place is ran like it is. The pizza was good.  Apparently cleaning anything is not required to work there. I'm curious to know if this is corporate or a franchise? The manager should be fired today for letting this place look like it is."
186,2,2,"The worst pizza joint around, placing an order for delivery was like pulling teeth! RUDE does not even cover it, From the minute they answer the phone, you'll wish you never called. The visit was even worse. The pizza was oily and the dough tasted stale. The restaurant was dirty and the staff acted like they could care less. No standards what so ever."
187,2,2,"The restaurant was dead when we walked in and got seated, then after a big group came in, we were asked to leave because they were too incompetent to serve a table of 3. Will never give this establishment my business."
188,2,4,"My mom and I went here last week, we were the only people in the restaurant with the two sketchy workers. Service was average, but after my mom paid, her credit card info got stolen and was used the day after. This was the only place she used her card, soo...if you go here I would advise paying with cash"
189,2,2,"Hello. When I placed my order with this location I was expecting to receive 8 breaded wings. Upon receiving my order I received 8 boneless wings. The wings were highly un satisfying in the sense that they were tough and slightly burnt. I immediately phoned the store manager eager to discover my options. The store manager informed me that I did not have any options and there was nothing he was going to do to rectify the issue. I was forced to keep a meal I did not enjoy. Along with the loss of $24.18. I value my money as anyone should. As my money was well earned I do not feel my money was well spent. I wish my experience were different. However, I do not think the store manager handled my concerns to the best of his trainings and knowledge. I am seeking reparation and would like to know who can assist me."
190,2,2,"The only way to describe my experience is: LONG AND DISORGANIZED!  This Pizza Hut is an utter mess, to say the least. The online specials were different from in store so I ordered while in store for pick up. There was a discrepancy with the order, where we waited 10 mins for the manager to come out and resolve the issue. No apologies. Nothing. We literally waited close to 1.5 hours for two medium pizzas and an order of eight bone in wings. Again no apologies. Now the young women cashiers were trying their best to accommodate all, but it just fell short. Not their fault, but I think it begins in the kitchen. Orders were incorrect, pizza were burnt (lady literally came back and asked the rhetorical question of: ""would you eat this?"" displaying burnt cheese on pizza. They did make her another one without any questions asked). What I think makes this place disorganized is the heater for the pizzas are for both carry-out and delivery. It causes confusion for patrons, cashiers and delivery workers. Its a brand-new establishment and there will be kinks. But what I experienced here was disturbing."
192,2,2,Pizza Hut has to do better with whom they choose as employees!!The food I got today was not quality at all!!!!! They basically put no effort into my order! Very disappointed!
191,1,4,"I went to this Pizza Hut with my fingers crossed and belly empty when I saw the all of the great specials on the banners out front.   There was a lady waiting for an order when i came in.  The cashier, super busy and dry, but was nice enough to tell us that the main special of $10 any pizza was available only online.  No problem.... so to the car I went.  Ordered waited and was in and out in 20 minutes.  Pizza and wings were fantastic. Will definitely be back, but will continue to order online, that poor lady was still in there waiting."
193,1,4,"Wanted to give this place a review due to the fact that they have some horrible, outdated reviews. I don't leave reviews often but when I do it's usually based on either a great experience, a terrible one, or a saving grace for an establishment. My partner and I were craving Pizza Hut so I came on yelp and saw that this location was the closest to my home. I saw that they had a mere 1 and a half or 2 and a half ratings and I almost changed my mind. I decided to read the reviews and the most recent one was from almost a year ago, everything else was from 3-5 years ago. So i decided to give it a go anyway. I ordered my food online and when I arrived my food was ready. The girl at the register was super polite and even gave my extra sauce for my chicken wings. I ordered a large pizza with 5 toppings, Stuffed garlic knots, buffalo wings and a cookie pie thing and everything was fresh, hot and delicious. It's hard to not judge a place based on their reviews but in my opinion, this Pizza Hut location is definitely worth a try!"
194,1,1,"Great experience! Ordered online and picked up, food was hot and delicious. Customer service was also good! Will definitely return!"
195,2,4,Tbh I thought Pizza Hut was good but maybe it's just this location . They got A 5$ deal going on and what not so I ordered me a hand tossed pepperoni and pineapple pizza with bbq and medium buffalo wings . When my food it honest to god look like they took all my shit out the dresser and just warmed it . Pizza was cold and thin . And don't get me started on my uncooked boneless wings . Had no sauce what so ever . Had the nerves to honestly send me that . I already think half yah know how mad I was . Idc about offering to bring a new pizza it's the principle that you shouldn't have to . My order should have been made with love and clearly you guys have people on there who don't care for they job and managers who clearly aren't checking work before it sent out . DO BETTER BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION AGAN !
196,2,4,After reading the reviews I don't know how this store is still in business. I though I was the only one who experienced not receiving their order. It happened to me on a Sunday where I never got my order and instead of learning my lesson I attempted to order from the restaurant again that following Thursday and of course... same s*it.This is incredible with these people. And to get them to answer the phone HA. Good luck with that!This pizza hut restaurant just messed it up for all of them cause I'll never order from any pizza hut restaurant again.
197,2,2,"This place is the complete worst, order food online for delivery, food never came, called themMultiple time they stated my food was on the way, i order the food at 730pm, online status show it would be delivered by 9pm, food never came, they stop taking my calls, called them the next day and spoke to a ""shift"" manager who stated i will have to call monday and speak to the head manager who could help me, place is the complete worst, will never order from them again..... i wouldve give them zero stars but i had to elect atleast one."
198,2,2,"Are you kidding me? You sold an uncooked Supreme Pizza where the dough is still stretching. Then when I called to tell you that you owe me a new pie, you told me to bring this one back after I have already driven 5 miles to my home. So, do you think I'm going to drive another 10 miles there and back for a $10 pizza? No rain check? 1) You lost a customer. What the hell kind of Pizza Hut doesn't know how to thoroughly cook a pizza? If you don't know that extra toppings add extra moisture, then you don't belong in the pizza business. If I could give you 0 Stars, I would. That is the absolute dumbest mistake a pizza place can make. You have to be really stupid to not know how to cook a pizza through before you serve it to a customer.2) You still owe me a supreme pizza and I'm going to get it delivered to my home for free with extra bread sticks for my trouble.This happened at 6:45 on June 5th of 2017."
199,2,2,"I'm VERY disappointed in the service because I actually LOVE Pizza Hut. I spent 30 minutes perfecting this pizza and its ashame I couldn't taste the fruits of my creative labor. Long story short, they never showed up."
200,2,4,Omg was so excited that pizza Hut finally opened in my area ..... the pizza was not up to standard it tasted like a knockoff frozen pizza the bread was very thick and  very dry the wings horrible I will stay with papa johns or dominoes
201,2,2,"The absolute worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. And I'm not even a big fan of commercial/franchise style pizza. However I like Pizzahut the best out of all of its competitors, Domino's and Papajohns. (Little Caesars not included yuck!) Anyway I put in a order to pick up on a night when I didn't want to cook so I thought I would buy something Good and Quick for my family....QUICK & GOOD is the furthest thing from this Pizzahut. After arriving to pick my dinner box up of 2 medium pepperoni pies. Bread sticks and Wings, I was informed that the wait will be 30mins-45mins to receive my food. Say what?! Almost an hour for pizza even after calling it in. At this moment I should have turned around.After waiting for almost an entire hour I got my food, from a girl at the cash register who seemed like the customers were all irritating her! One young lady came back and noted that her pizza was cold and another man came back with the wrong order.When I arrived home and opened my Pizza box I then realized my order was correct however my Pizza was in fact cold and the cheese on the pizza was burnt. I only gave this place 2 stars because the wings were a different touch from other pizza places. Not better, just different. The wings at this particular location are first fried THEN tossed in sauce. Which I thought was the only positive here. I will stick with the Pizza Hut in Ozone Park Queens."
202,2,2,The worst ever place an order online and patiently waited for an hour when i called to find out what was going on u was told by a young lady that it was cancel smh now where i live when something goes wrong with an order they notify you but this place didn't even care first and last time smh. Clearly customer service was not taught at this place
203,4,1,The wait is long but what do you expect for something new... Wings are good and the pizza is better than dominos
204,2,4,The wait is way to long . They are never open late night . The service is horrible. But the pizza is better than dominos. But they always seem to forget something that I order & I end up waiting longer for the rest of my food ..
205,2,2,They delivered a burn up pizza and breadsticks with no sauce. Calling to get through take forever. They just need to shut down and horrible service.
206,2,2,the absolute! worse!!!!!!!! ordered at 5:04 food came 7:15! i'm all for freshly made pizza but damn!!!!! 2 hours you have to be kidding me
207,1,1,I'm so happy that a Pizza Hut finally opened in my neighborhood I loved the pizza the service could be a little better but what do you expect they just opened
208,2,2,"Unprofessional is an understatement. I placed 2 orders online within minutes of one another and they were supposed to be done at the same time. I got there a few minutes late on purpose, and my wings were just coming out 5 minutes after my arrival. I asked about my pizza and was told that they were on 170 something and I was 180 something. Fast forward to 40 minutes later and I'm still waiting. I check on my pizza again and am told that there was no more chicken, no call or any type of notification whatsoever. The manager was at the register giving refunds and neither her nor the cashier apologized or even tried to make things right. Corporate was emailed as soon as I got home. Will never go to this pizzahut again."
209,1,1,"I didn't check yelp before ordering here- ordered straight through the app, had a prob ordering, called and they were great over the phone. Food was hot, fresh, and exactly what I ordered. I have to say I was expecting mediocrity but was pleasantly surprised with flavor! Ok Pizza Hut! Way to keep a long time customer happy. *thin crust pizza"
210,2,2,"Horrible food . Everything tasted old and gross my children didn't eat it and the one that did had diarrea ,I called the store and they gave me a run around , never apologize for it or explained the most they offer was $10 dollars off my next purchase, I spoke to Sabrina that told me she wasn't authorized to give me a refund and the person that could was on "" vacation "". Very disappointed My advice don't eat from there if you don't want to waste your money"
211,1,4,"Pizza Hut is a place that makes good pizza (and other things but I like their pizza more than all the rest). I read some of the reviews here and many do not give them best the best rating. But rather give them the rating more based on their delivery service, their customers service and such. Now I know that when you rate a place you consider many things. And me myself had some mistakes made on my orders. But in terms of fast food pizza, Pizza Hut is one of the best places for Pizza."
212,1,1,I really like the pizza quality at this location despite what the other reviewers are sayin.  I ordered a medium sausage and breadsticks and it was on.  This location seems to put on way more toppings than other locales so they're good with me.
213,2,4,"I have the unfortunate displeasure of living across the street from this godforsaken place.Many months ago I awoke to an extremely loud ear splitting sound. Although this is common living on Myrtle Ave, this sound didn't stop. It just kept on going... what I discovered were that some employees of this particular Pizza Hut seemed to be power washing something on the sidewalk. For hours. After a long shouting match eventually they stopped. The days passed by and I thought this was the end of my power washing nightmare. I was wrong.Last night (Sunday night) at 1AM I heard a familiar and terrible sound, like a hurricane was tearing up my sidewalk. Immediately I knew the power washing perpetrators were back. So after an hour of putting up with it I went outside to confront them. After screaming at the unfortunate employees who were had the burden of power washing thrust upon them by their capitalist pig bosses, I discovered the reason that they were committing this heinous offense, and the true reason for this 1 star review.Apparently, once every 6 months, they take the grills out of their ovens and power wash them on the side walk. Which means that for 6 months they allow all the grime of every pizza they cook build up on these disgusting hunks of metal, only hiring someone to wash them after there appliances have gotten so horribly grimy that to wait any longer would make those ovens the only thing more wretchedly sickening than the NYC subway system.I'm not one for noise complaints or things of that ilk. The noise of life is one thing that I love and appreciate about living in NYC. The daily sound of buses and garbage trucks are loud reminders that there are so many wonderful people outside my window working together in their own little ways to keep this city running. To quote the inimitable Jane Jacobs ""...although it is life, not art, it's may fancifully call it the art form of the city and liken it to the dance -- not to a simple-minded precision dance with everyone kicking up at the same time, twirling in unison and bowing off en masse, but to an intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole.""But is this really necessary?Like why do you have to wait till 1 AM on a Sunday when everyone is sleeping to do this? Why not set up some cones at PM and do it then? Or maybe clean the ovens with brushes idk like every week or so like any normal place would? God this place is as disgusting as it is offensive."
214,2,2,Be aware of the delivery guy he's a thief. He doesn't carry enough cash so he can keep the change. He took $12.16 from me talking about he didn't have change. Smh I'll never buy from here again. The pizza was good thou and it was warm. Sorry for the rest of the Pizza Hut crew who have to take the heat because of one person.
216,2,2,"I kind of laughed as I was reading the other reviews of this Pizza Hut, but yes, this place really is comical in an ""Oh God, I can't believe I'm about to eat this"" kind of way.Rus walked in and ordered 8 wings and cheesy bread (didn't even get a pizza). It probably took at least 30 minutes for us to get our food, but that's not even what bothered me the most.The man in the back making our food didn't wear any gloves as he handled anything, he was also talking on his cellphone and going between touching his phone and food every few minutes. Gross.They also throw all of the oven trays into a huge garbage can. Weird.The manager was okay, but he seemed a little disgruntled whenever people would call.Sigh. Should have known better and trusted my fellow Yelpers! But do yourself a favor and get  your grub elsewhere. There's a pizzeria right across the street and their food never takes longer than 10 minutes."
217,2,2,"Disgusting pizza, I had a mushroom topping on my slice and I took it off and found a piece of hair under it. If I would of never taken that mushroom off I probably would have ate that piece of hair. Terrible service I had to wait 3 hours for the delivery as well. And the guy on the phone was very rude when I tried to place my order. Here is a picture of my slice. The pizza was also very cold and soggy. First and last time I'm ever getting pizza hut."
215,2,4,Loved Pizza Hut in the past always tastes good came to order some take out place was empty I ordered the special that came with 2 free toppings when I asked for extra cheese I was told that would be extra and was not considered a free topping wtf since when is extra cheese not considered a topping the girl explained it was company policy and not up to her. Guess I won't be coming back until they fix this ridiculous policy
218,2,2,I really wish I can give this place a negative rating. I ordered a large two topping pizza and boneless sauced wings. The wings barely had sauce and the pizza had less cheese than the wings had sauce. The toppings on the pizza tasted like dirt and I immediately got sick after eating.
219,2,2,"I wish I could give this place -5 stars. People, please take these reviews seriously. This Pizza Hut is a dive. Delivery ran 1 hr 35mins late. When I called to inquire about the order they put you on hold for the longest time...give you a thousand and one excuses...and lie about your order having left already. When it finally arrived it was cold and with toppings I didn't even ask for. Honestly it was worse than little Caesars. These people should be arrested for serving garbage."
220,2,2,"Horrible customer service, order took almost 2 hours...  & i live down the block.  We refused the pizza and from domino's"
221,2,2,Two cheese pizzas with burnt cheese was not my idea for a nice meal. Why would they serve that....I think they reheated old pizza and then sent it to us.....not happy. This was the second time for carryout....nope ...never again.
223,2,2,"Well, that was even more depressing than I'd expected.Semi-understanding my fondness for pizza, my dear mother sent me a Pizza Hut gift card.Hey, it's free food, right?Wow, you can order online now?I walked over to pick up my pie, with vague childhood memories of cheesy satisfaction. Dominos was the terrible one, right?The shop is a bit depressing, and feels like the fast-food restaurant that it is, except dimmer and grungier than most.By the time I got it home, the pizza was already lukewarm. I had opted for the thin/crispy crust, which may have been my misstep; or maybe ordering olives/tomatoes/mushrooms instead of the safer cheese.Or, maybe, it is no fault of my own, and this place just makes terrible pizza. Worse than I recall Dominos being, worse than dollar slices.Limp, cardboard-esque crust, low-grade toppings, zero flavor. It wasn't even cut correctly.And the ""breadsticks"" were a square of pre-formed bread product with a film of butter or oil around the outside and poorly-indented perforations with which one is apparently supposed to separate the ""sticks.""Don't bother, even if it is free."
224,1,1,I had a really nice experience and I am sorry for the yelp reviewers that had a bad encounter. I ordered online and  total was 27.50. I thought I told the lady over the phone can she charge the credit card including a tip she said she couldn't so I was like ok will tip the person when they came. It came 30 minutes after I called and I was pleased. I gave the lady the tip and some extra for the fast delivery. The pizza was really good fresh and hot and the chocolate chip cookie pie was delicious! Maybe the people who were rude no longer work there and they got new people. Either way I order from this Pizza Hut alone and when I like something  I just keep buying from the same place. So I only order from this Pizza Hut now.
222,2,2,"Ordered delivery for cheese stuffed cheese pizza..told the lady over the phone to add some marinara sauces on the side..40 mins later it arrives with no sauces like I repeatedly told her to include and the pizza tasted like sh!t!! No, I'm not just saying that..it literally tasted and smelled like someone pissed in it and prepared it after they used the toilet without washing there hands first! They just used mass amount of salt to make it taste like it's been properly "" prepared""I was honestly disgusted that I payed such price and will never ever ever ever get close or even think about ordering from here!"
225,1,4,The pizza is great but most of the staff is rude. Lol there is one Latina woman who's nice though. I guess the bad reviews are pretty accurate depiction of the staff.
226,2,2,"WORST PIZZA HUT EVER!!!!! We went to pick our pizza up so I can not speak on the delivery service. I can however speak on how HORRIBLE their pizza is! We got a cheesy crust pizza but they was no cheese in the crust. The pizza was limp and hard to pull apart. I ordered bread sticks. They were flat, chewy, and old looking. I will EVER EVER order from here again. In fact I'm going to tell Pizza Hut they need to look into this store because the product they are producing is WWAAYY off of the Pizza Hut brand."
227,1,1,"I got exactly what I ordered and it was delivered in 40 minutes just like I was told. Oh,The delivery person looked like my uncle"
228,2,2,This place is the absolute worst!!!! I called and complained to corporate and they felt so bad they emailed me a free pizza. I wouldn't eat there ever again. They can keep that nasty a** pizza wouldn't care if it was free.
229,2,2,I wish it was possible to get a location negative stars. I have had nothing but terrible customer service from the shit storm of the store and I have filed a complaint with not only Pizza Hut itself but also with the Better Business Bureau. I have absolutely no problem going on every social media outlet and doing nothing but blasting this company and its manager Persaud for his deplorable customer service. my husbands family has that has been delivered to from this location for years and all of a sudden they no longer deliver within a mile radius. they lost a lifetime customer and I will do nothing and nothing in my power to get these people shut down.
230,2,2,Always try to give them a chance bcuz I really enjoy pizza hut but this has got to be the worst chain ever!! I asked that my food be fresh on delivery they guy said it get there when it gets there. How rude. Food was warm I'm never ordering here again ever !!
231,2,2,"I ordered food here and had a super bad experience. There was a short girl with long brown hair working in the front on a sunday night. She was extremely rude over the phone it was no wonder I got hung up on twice and had a hard time ordering. When I got there to pick up my food, I witnessed her literally yelling and speaking extremely rude to every customer over the phone. Also purposely hanging up on people and loudly slamming the phone down; this went on dozens of times while I was waiting for my food. She was also cursing out loud in front of customers and just clearly full of hate for even being there. Such a bad way to represent the location and business. She was also super rude to everyone inside the store and had the biggest attitude on earth. I felt bad because you can tell she's miserable and hates her job, but there's something called professionalism which she did not have one bit. When I saw the way she was acting, I was SO glad she wasn't the one handling the food or else I would have walked out so quickly. Not only did I have to wait over 25 minutes for literally one tiny thing, but I had to listen to that monstrosity of an employee the whole time. That girl was the worst worker I've ever seen and such an embarrassment to the restaurant. I suggest they find someone that can handle a busy night and that can be professional because that was terrible and super ghetto. This place will always be a dump along with their retarded waste of life employees. It's only a matter of time before this shit hole closes down."
232,2,2,Okay so I'm the first to review this Pizza Hut. I ordered online with my boyfriend and I live only 5 blocks away from this place. I have a pizzeria right by my house but we decided to try something different. It took literally 2 HOURS for the pizza to come! We didn't even get a discount or an apology or whatever. Plus the pizza was cold when it got here. We had to warm it up again. Ugh. Never again.
233,2,2,took forever and the pizza came cold  it took over a 1hour and 45 minutes honestly the pepsi was better
236,2,3,"So the time is now 3:17 PM in the afternoon I decide to grab a quick bite while waiting on my medication from the pharmacy. Me: "" I would like a caesar salad""Pizza hut lady: ""Were out of salad""Me: "" Ok let me get an order of Mild wings""Pizza hut lady: "" We're out of wings too""ME:"
237,2,2,if i can give 0 stars i will! i just want to start by saying this place is terrible! I went in there to get an athenian salad  it was sitting at the counter for like 10 minutes I had to ask if I can receive it the person just ignored me and put the meat in the oven again causing it  to get burnt and then she gives it to me and I told her was to Burnt that if I can get a new one she ignores my question and just gives me a refund I told her I didn't want a refund I just wanted a salad that wasn't burnt and she refused to make me another salad. I also forgot to add before making my salad she scratches her weave and uses the same glove for my.salad
234,2,4,Bruh I love the hut but my mom doesn't so I went with my dad today I was so excited until there were no workers there.idk if they were on break but all the signs were on.so yeah no more Pizza Hut
240,2,2,The worst! I was given plain bread sticks that was barely cut. The pizza was horrible and we were not given what we ordered! I strongly recommend not ordering from here!
241,4,4,Very average but still good. Any time you can get a couple of 3 topping stuff crust pizzas 30% off is a good deal. Light on topping but acceptable. Too bad they no longer offer anchovies. Easy parking too.
242,2,2,"I ordered pizza for my organization...twice, the first time I ordered about 20 pies and my order arrived 45 minutes late with no apologies....nothing. The second time I ordered 3 pies for a team meeting. The delivery driver told me to come outside because he could not find parking (seriously on National Holiday when alternate side of the street parking is suspended in NYC) so I come downstairs and wait. I called him back because I do not see him, but I see lots of parking spots....he tells me he on the adjacent street, he sees me....(pause). I prepaid delivery charges and a tip, yeah you need to ride around the block and bring that pizza to me. He seriously expected me to walk over to him after he was on the adjacent block and there was parking right in from of the school, not cool. And HE had an attitude...ok! I will not patronize this location EVER AGAIN.These reviews are a direct reflection of the service you will receive at this location."
243,4,4,Food came fast but the bread sticks were not cut all the way ... you can tell it was just a half assed order things thrown in the bag and it was not ass good as other places first and last time ordering from here .... 5.2/10
244,1,1,"Dear People of the World,Do you like pizza? Yes or no? Do you like toppings on your pizza? If you like pizza, then come to Ascend Charter School.  Because there is a Pizza Hut store at this school! At Pizza Hut, there are many pizzas that are amazing!  One reason Pizza Hut is the best, is the pizzas are cheesy. They put stretchy cheese on top of the pizza.  They also put melted cheese inside the pizza crust. When I eat the cheese, it feels like I'm in cheesy heaven.  A second reason is, they put pineapples on the pizza. You can also get it with no pineapples. You can make your own pizza with whatever toppings you want, like pepperoni or mushrooms. All the toppings are delicious. You should get it when you get out of school or work or anytime you are hungry. From,Penn State"
245,4,4,"Since the Empire location is closed, this is the closest option before Ridgewood Queens. I placed my order online and it was ready when I arrived.  The lobby was packed with kids and a few adults, all waiting patiently for orders.  The employees were friendly, and that was about it.  I noticed they didnt have one of the giant warmers for the food, hence my pizza being kinda lukewarm.  Parking can be touch and go (meters only).  If we're in serious need maybe we will come back."
246,2,2,2 hours since I placed my order and still no food. I really wish I would have thought to come here and read reviews prior to placing my order but.....alas. Thank god that I opted to make a cash payment upon arrival had I prepaid for this order I would be LIVID.Don't do it y'all!
247,2,4,"I will begin by saying I was extremely thrilled to hear there was a Pizza Hut opening in our neightborhood when the flyer was in my mailbox. I made it a priority to order since I hadn't had Pizza Hut since leaving Virginia 3 years ago. A lot of New Yorkers frown upon commerical pizza chains but Pizza Hut was more nostaligic than anything. Growing up in the South we would order a pizza on friday night and play video games until we passed out as kids. When I placed my order at 9:05 I was given a 9:55 delivery time. I completely understand this being automated so no biggie. When 10:32 came around and my delivery guy called. I gave the benefit of the doubt since it's new. He immediately apologized for it being late. Now I live on the 7 minutes walking from this place, and my pizza and wings were both cold. Not cold as in some warmth left trapped somewhere in the box, but cold as in my thin crust crispy, wasn't crispy. Cheese was dry, bacon was plasticky at this point. I was disappointed.  An hour and half wait time and 7 minutes away and I get cold food?I'm not sure what to really make of it all. But with little to no good delivery pizza options in the area, I've given up on one of my favorite pastimes. Other reviews seem to be on par with some of the same issues. Hopefully this will improve and management will reach out to those that have had bad experiences but until then, no thumbs up over here."
248,2,2,"I had to contact corporate due to the lack of service at this spot. They gotta stop working with door dash or have a better system for ""tracking orders"". My order never even came, i had to call 3 times to speak with 3 unhelpful enployees who either gave me attitude and basically had me wait outside for a delivery person whe never showed (i was told they were a block away, after 15 mins is when i made the second call and that was the same situation). It was a two and a half hour ordeal and i never got my food since the store stopped answering calls -which is understandable since they had closed at this point but like i said, i was waiting for a while and the order was placed an hour and a half before closing time.And the time before this, i had specific direction (which no other delivery person has issue with cuz it's supposed to help both the delivery person and myself ‍) to call when turning onto my block so i can meet driver outside and the guy calls me aggressively yelling at me about where i'm at and how he needs to go cuz there's no parking. That was whatever but this spot is trash."
249,2,2,"Wow why would you hire these people they have no customer service they are rude and they take forever just to make a damn personal pie all you hear in the back is ""bro"" ""bro"""
250,2,2,Annoying ass bitch ass employees...gonna say they called me and didn't when I did deliver
251,2,2,1 star based on the delivery alone. Delivery will take well over an hour to get to you and the food will be cold. And this location is less than 2 miles away.
252,2,2,I've ordered from the Pizza Hut 4x now it literally takes over an hour to receive the orders from here.. Absolutely ridiculous.. Slowest Pizza Hut in the history of delivery.
253,2,2,Delivery takes wayyyy to long ... I live 5 mins away from there ... & food was cold both times I ordered .... This is by far the worst Pizza Hut Ive ever had ... Wish they hadn't open it because they given Pizza Hut a bad look ... Maybe it will get new management & improve .
254,2,2,"I live in the neighborhood and was very excited to hear that a Pizza Hut was opening around the corner from me.  All of my experiences at that location were not pleasant.  No one ever answers the phone, there is always a longer wait time and most of all the customer service stinks.  People only go there because the pizza is very good.  I called and made a complaint at the Cooperate headquarters and was sent coupons for two large pizzas.  I went back to the location and the cashier did not even greet me she acted like I was on the welfare line NEXT she said with an attitude.  The pizza was very good I give it 5 stars but the customer service is horrible they really need to hire people with better customer service skills. No body wants to deal with other people's nasty attitudes.  Please think about hiring better quality staff,  sorry it's a thumbs down for me."
255,2,2,"The absolute f#*king worst food preparation and customer service. The woman that made my pizza slammed the phone down on the table, walked away and then came back an hung up on me and when I tried to call back, she re-routed my call when I was trying to tell her that the ingredients on the pizza were very skimpy. I am on the phone with corporate now. They don't deserve to operate under the name of Pizza Hut with service like this and they just opened; starting off on the wrong foot already. Been a customer for years. Never again at this location. Wish I would've known to check their reviews before ordering because they're all bad."
256,2,3,"Today at approximately 1345 hrs., I came into Pizza Hut located at 1501 Pitkin ave Brooklyn ny 11212 and was getting ready to ask the cashier what specials there were. Before I had the opportunity to get the sentence out the cashier, Millie, interrupted me mid sentence and stated ""we don't have specials this ain't the express hut."" I tried to explain numerous times that I've order the special pan pizza with 4 bone out wings but she over talked me every chance she got. When I went to my phone and ordered the special I was looking for and came in the store to pay for my order, I explained to Millie that I found the special I was looking for. Instead of her aploligizing for her rude and distasteful and ratchet ass attitude, she said ""well yeah Y'ALL don't listen. That's only online or at the express."" I again tried to reiterate that she never explained that to me and was very rude. She deflected by staring $9.24 is your total....swipe when you see the green light. All I could do was laugh at the brown tooth, disrespectful, foul mouth, foul odor, fire breathing dragon from game of thrones 'cashier' MILLIE. This is not the first or second time that I've had horrible customer service from this SAME Pizza Hut branch. I'm extremely irritated that I have to spend my hard earned money and be treated so vile. I'm so close to never ordering from Pizza Hut EVER AGAIN. You guys need to invest in adequate training for staff and stop hiring these ghetto ass stink breath hood rats!!!!! I will be copying and pasting this complaint to every social media outlet I have (Facebook, Instagram, twitter & yelp just to name a few)"
257,2,2,"Terrible service!!! My order came in late and was missing my order of wings. The driver had the nerve to say they forgot to put my wings in the bag and that I have to call them to send another driver to deliver. I called, the manager said we will get the wings within 20 minutes... 30 minutes later I had to call back... Finally the same driver came back with an attitude and of course the wings were cold! Will never order from that place again!!!"
258,2,4,"Messed up my toppings. Incredibly slow delivery time. Cold, bland pizza once it arrived. The staff don't have a care in the world, acting bored and annoyed. However, the dining area was made and set perfectly. Bathroom is very sanitary."
259,2,2,"Never order onlineI ordered online once after going to pizza hutfor years and nobody even started the pizza 4hours after I ordered and after all that I didn'treceive ant points, a coupon, and barelyreceived an apology I got one after explainingI've waited 4 hours! It annoyed me so much Ihad to make a yelp post a month after thishappened its a great place just horrible at keeping online orders"
260,2,2,This place is absolutely horrible! They arrived 1.5 hours early with my Super Bowl food and I scheduled this at 9am and paid in ADVANCE to receive by food at 6:30pm. They do not answer their phones ever and they are only 2 blocks away as I received ice cold food. How do you run a business like this? Pizza and wings are so simple as you use tons of frozen product! DO NOT order from here unless you'd like to be upset on timeliness and food quality as well no answers to your complaint. You lost a customer Pizza Hut. You are falling apart and now we see why your losing branches.
261,1,1,We used to be long time customer of Pizza Hut dining in but slowly stopped because of the slow delivery when we stopped dining in... and one time getting a horrible pie that was assembled poorly...BUT!!!!!!....We have ordered about 4 times in the past two months and have gotten our pizza and sides within 30-40 min!!!! We didn't wait hours like a few years ago. I waited a while to see if it was consistent or just a good day for them and it has been consistent the past 4 times with delivering! Good is delicious as expected from the hut!I'm not sure if owners changed or not but whatever they're doing to deliver as quickly as possible and fresh food they're doing right this time!!!
262,2,2,"I stopped ordering from this Pizza Hut a long time ago due to their slow delivery time and unprofessional service. Today my kids asked if I could order Pizza Hut so I gave in and figured let's try it out. It was early and a Thursday night so I thought it couldn't be too bad. Boy am I mad I decided to even bother! The order took an hour and a half to get here which I expected so I'm not even mad about that. What I am upset about is my card being charged twice and the way it was handled. I called the restaurant as soon as I realized it. First the person that answered told me that the manager did it twice by accident because she was in a rush so I have to wait 3-5 for my refund. I then asked to speak with the manager. I spoke with Anaisa. First she told me that Pizza Hut has a new system where customers are charged twice if you leave the tip on the card. I responded with that is impossible as this has never happened before. I insisted that it sounded like an excuse. Then she told me that the driver told her to do it twice because he was in a rush and had to go. I asked her how is a driver telling a manager how to process payments...she had no answer and went back to well you just have to wait 5-7 days. Before I was told 3-5 but that also changed. I told her all I really wanted was for her to take ownership of the situation. She would not. She told me to call tomorrow and speak with someone else. As if that was going to help. I now have two charges on my card for one delivery. Let's see when this refund happens, if it ever does. She ended the call with there was nothing she could do and that is just their system. Anaisa was unprofessional and did not take ownership of her mistake. Very sad when that type of attitude comes from a manager that is supposed to be leading a team"
263,2,2,I wish I could give them less that one star because believe me I most definitely would. If you're thinking of ordering from here DONT. Worst decision you'll make. Waited 3 hours for my order to be delivered. Every time we'd call the store to ask what was going on they would hang up on us. The one time we actually got to speak to someone she told us she would contact the driver and get back to us and never did. We got the pizza 3 hours later and it was cold. Worst experience ever this place should be shut down
264,2,4,Pizza it's great. Customer service is the girl that served me was very rude and in polite she literally threw the plates on the table might as well just have throw them from the kitchen and hit me with them. TERRIBLE.
265,2,2,"Horrible Service Overall. My delivery ETA boosted up to 2 hours and stood on Hold for 10 minutes when I tried to figure out why its taking so long for delivery. I prefer Pizza Hut over anybody else, but this is uncalled for. I literally will never order anything from here again! Crazy how one store will change your views on the entire company.."
266,2,2,"This is my first review EVER but it had to be done. We Will NEVER order from Pizza Hut, especially this one again ! My husband and I placed an order for one ( 1 ) large cheese pizza online at 8:24 PM, at 8:57 PM we received a text saying "" Pizza is out for delivery "" at 10:26 pm pizza was still not delivered. We contacted the store via phone two times 30 minutes apart and were told each time the pizza left the store 10 minutes ago which was at 9:40 PM. FINALLY I get to speak to a manager who is HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL, PIZZA HUT should be ashamed of the service she provides. She tells me "" It's not your fault, it's our fault, I only have one driver "" Well thank you for clearing the air and saying it's not my fault, obviously it's not my fault. She then begins to tell me she will issue me a $10 store credit for my next visit. At this point, I don't want the $10 credit because I know I'll never order from this s**t hole again and I damn sure do not want a pizza that has been out for delivery for over an hour. She then proceeded to tell me that for a refund I would need to wait 3-7 days, fantastic. So, we waited at this point over two hours for 1 cheese pizza that never showed up and now up to a week for the refund. And it's not about the money, the order was a measly $26, it's the principal of how this establishment runs a business and then deals with its issues. I would have given 0 stars but unfortunately that is not an option, so 1 it is."
267,2,2,Ordered a Hawaiian pie (ham and pineapples) waited over an hour for the pie to be done. Once I received the pie it only had the ham so I went back to get the right pie and what they did was throw on a pile of pineapples (which was only one 3 slices) and reheated it up. It was not a legit Hawaiian mix pizza. Pretty much half ass work. I do not recommend this location to anyone. Now that I looked at the reviews it explains a lot on top of my experience.
268,2,2,"Literally THE worst staff I've ever seen at a dine-in. Walked in, stood there for 5min before being greeted by a man. We asked for a table and the waitress said out loud ""ugh are you serious?"" as she dragged her feet into the back. I asked what time they closed, they said 11, but they are sitting people till 10.We walked in at 9:30, a full hour and a half before they closed and still the waitress complained? ""Why do people keep coming innnn?!"" sighing and rolling her eyes like a whiny brat. ""Are you sure you don't want to carry out?"" the man who greeted us asked. YES, I'M SURE! The female waitress pouted once more and we decided to just leave. Not going to be served by an unkempt baby who cries about customers (who put money in her pocket) BEFORE we even get to sit down."
269,2,2,WORST PIZZA HUT EVER !!!! Ordered 2 hrs ago still no pizza!! Been calling & they pick up & hang up on you.Rude people... don't order from this place especially if it's delivery/ takeout save yourself the money.This is the second time they've done this. Never ordering from here againTHE WORSTTTTT !!!!!!!
270,2,2,"I haven't had Pizza Hut in like 15 years. I don't know why I even got tempted. Absolutely awful - Pizza came raw! They sent another one, almost 2 hours between the first order and it wasn't even what I ordered... Don't do it."
271,2,2,Order at 8:25 PM two hours later still waiting for my order.. This is the second time I order from this Pizza Hut and second time we encountered the same issue except the first time the pizza never made. Terrible service!!
272,1,4,"Their pizza is delicious and there is not just that there is a lot of food to chose from.When you eat there,their food service is quick,but delivery needs some improvement."
273,2,2,"They are completely unprofessional ,, they allow the phone to ring over and over before someone actually gets it,, my time spent here I seen 2 people walk out from waiting to be taken care of. Ridiculous!"
274,2,2,"Do not expect effective service if you wanna go to this store. I should have yelped before ordering their takeout online. I ordered and went to the store. It took the cashier five minutes to get to me when there was only one lady before me, who also had an online order. After we both paid, the cashier simply left, without checking if our food was ready. There soon formed a long line not attended. I waited for another ten minutes and asked if they could check if my order was ready. It took them another three minutes to check, only to find out my food was ready and I saw the bowl of wings sitting in the waiting area when I first entered the store. So was the lady who was in front of me's pizza. Unbelievable. The wings did not taste as good as they should've."
275,2,2,First time ordering here and will never come back. Ordered online and was told the pizza would be ready in 15 minutes. I went to pick it up and waited in the restaurant for an hour. When I finally go the pizza it was cold and had the wrong crust and my boyfriend got food poisoning the day after. The service was also terrible and when I asked when the order would be ready the cashier ignored me and started talking to her friend.
276,2,2,"I've been a loyal customer here, but it seems like the service and products are getting worse and worse. After today's experience, I'm absolutely done with this place. Today is Super Bowl Sunday, and I ordered a pizza online at 5:30pm. It said the delivery time was 7:30pm, so I waited patiently. By the time 8:30 rolled around - an hour after it was supposed to be delivered - I called the place and asked to speak to the manager. She said that they hadn't even started making my pizza yet! She claimed that the high density of orders got them all mixed up and they were behind on all their orders. This was a whole HOUR after my pizza was supposed to be delivered! Meanwhile, we were all hungry at my Super Bowl party, and I feel like an awful hostess. The manager gave me a $10 credit for next time, but I think this may be the last time I order from this particular branch."
277,2,2,"This place is getting the one star because the food did eventually come. Although, when we ordered it said delivery would be in 35-45 minutes and it was about an hour and 45 minutes. When we got our food it was cold, and we were told instead of a refund all they could offer was store credit, even though we live out of town, are here on vacation and are leaving tomorrow. Horrible customer service."
278,2,2,Don't waste your money at this location. The WORST service and food I've ever seen at a Pizza Hut ever!
279,2,4,Well the second review starts by saying why do I have to wait nearly 15 minutes for the little kids that work here to take my order. After finally taking my order I waited a reasonable amount of time (lol). After the order came I had to consistently remind the young lady that there were missing items to which she bright everything but one thing but that's OK. At the end of the meal I had to get up and go and pay rather than wait for her to bring me the check because I would have waited there forever anyway this place is sub par but eventually it's customer service and standards will one day work its way up to that of a gas station
280,1,1,We frequently do pick up from here. The location sucks with traffic all the time but the pizzas are good! We always order online - 2 medium pizzas (10 ingredients) for $14 - a pretty good deal! Never had any issues with our orders.
281,2,2,I ordered over 50 dollars worth of food waited an hour and a half for it to be delivered it was completely cold and the order was incomplete. I called them up to tell them as was hung up on 3 times before someone told they could not do anything about the missing food except refund me and sorry the food was cold that was my problem. I ended up calling corporate and they gave me a link to file my complaint 2 days later I received a phone call from the manager who apologized and offered me a 20 dollar gift card before I could ask how i would use this gift card I was hung up on. This place hands down has the worst customer service i have ever seen of any place.
282,2,2,"Just like other reviews here, I have been ordering pizza hut for 15 years all over the world and this place is the worst I have ever experienced. Ordered my pizza at 11:37 am online and the expected delivery time was 12:07 pm. I waited until 12:35 pm and called the store. The phone rang for about 2 minutes but no one answered so I thought the store was closed. This lady picks up the phone at very last minute and speaks very unfriendly. I asked her if my pizza is coming and wanted some kind of an explanation why it's coming late but only thing she says is, ""5 to 10 minutes"". I was clearly able to feel that she didn't want to talk to me and I also didn't want to talk to a clerk with such attitude. I got my pizza at 12:55 pm, opened the pizza and it was cold so I had to heat it up in microwave (first time in my life putting fresh pizza in microwave). As I was about to pick up the second piece, I saw a narrow thing sticking out of my slice. At first, I thought it was cheese melted narrowly but as I pulled it out, I was shocked to see super long hair of a lady. I didn't feel like eating anymore so threw out the whole pizza. I promise I will never order from this place again and they should know that there are other pizza franchises with better qualities. I highly recommend you to order Dominos or Papa Johns if you are going to order from this Pizza Hut, since other franchises have very friendly customer service mind and high quality pizzas."
283,2,2,"Ha! Please, why did I even bother to order food from here. It's my own fault really. But is it that hard to hire competent staff to get orders right? If only I could put negative stars."
284,2,2,"This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever had. They always get my order wrong in some way, either forgetting items and/or messing up the toppings & ingredients. The pizza is always way too greasy and soggy. I seriously think one time I had spoiled pepperoni on my pizza because it was sour smelling & tasting. Pizza Hut either needs to drastically overhaul this location, or shut it down. I've had no problem with the service tho, they're at least nice on the phone. Also, most of the photos are from the advertising part of Pizza Hut, not specifically from this location, so they aren't really helpful."
285,2,2,Horrible service . Shame on you for the staff working there . Grow up and be very professional.
286,2,2,The worst service ever! I placed a pick-up order after a long Friday at work so that I could get in and get out. I arrived a half an hour later and my order was not ready. I checked in with the cashier 3 separate times and was told that my order was being prepared. I waited for over an hour to be told by another server that my phone order was never entered into the system! Stay away at all costs!
287,2,2,The service in this place is very poor and unprofessional they speak to the clients very harch on the phone and always like 2 hrs for ur delivery to arrive
288,2,2,"2 hours for pizza delivery, and everything came cold. Driver didn't even bother to read delivery instructions."
289,2,2,"I had the worst experience with this Pizza hut. They sent me a bitten Hershey Dunkers desert. It was absolutely disgusting, my appetite was gone immediately. I called the next day and the manager wasn't even concerned all he did was give me credit for the desert. My advice don't order from here if you don't want a half even desert!"
290,2,2,"If you're craving Pizza Hut, pick it up yourself. Otherwise let it be known that this was the worst delivery experience I've encountered and the pizza wasn't all that. Indtead, go to little Caesars and pick up a nice warm pie! Or, for the ultimate delivery experience and delivery, it's gotta be dominos baby! Thanks for ruining football night ""Pizza Hut!"""
291,2,2,The worst delivery experience I've ever had!  They deserve no stars.  The order took an hour longer than the quoted time.  It arrived incomplete.  The restaurant basically told me I could wait a few hours and get it later.  It was ridiculous I just wanted them to refund my cc for the food they didn't deliver.  They refused and hung up on me.
293,2,2,"I always check Yelp reviews before eating anywhere and I seen the 1.5 stars.  It's Pizza Hut.  How bad can it really be?  We go in about between 9-10pm on a Sunday and ordered a large stuff crust pizza with extra extra beef, pineapple, and no sauce on the pizza and sauce on the side for me.  The pizza comes out with sauce on it.  It has to be sent back.  It comes out again this time with sausage.  My boyfriend is allergic to pork and could've been a bad situation if we had not noticed right away.  My side of sauce never came either.At that point in time, we just had to leave.  The waitress took the order right, but clearly there's some seriously incompetent people working in the kitchen.  Our waitress and manager were very apologetic but didn't change the fact that we came hungry and left hungry."
292,2,2,"I am glad , I checked out the reviews and did not go ahead. We waited for 10 mins with no one greeting at the entry asking us what do we want.It looks like the owner if this place doesn't care about customer service."
294,2,2,"I wish I could give this place one star , ordered boneless wings which were undercooked proceeded to order the marshmallow brownie which took 30 mins to come out ( made us miss our movie) than when Rajatt brought it out , your local pizza hut manager he didn't bring us forks.  Never asked for refills we had to ask him and it was water.  Worse place ever worse service ever"
295,4,4,Surprisingly I never had an issue with this location. Although they do take long to deliver the food at times.
296,2,2,Don't order from here if you want your food quick. I ordered my food almost 2 hours ago and it still hasn't come. I recommend another pizza place that is non corporate due to better service. There are plenty in this area
297,4,1,"Among the cozier Pizza Hut establishments around. Pizza Hut is Pizza Hut. Cheap and to the point. Get some boneless buffalo wings, a pie, and call it a day."
298,2,2,"I placed an online order, was charged and my order never showed up. I called after an hour and a half and was told it left for delivery so should arrive soon. After two hours I called several times to cancel and get my money back but no one answered my calls. I hate that I have to give them a star. Worst service ever!"
299,2,2,"ordered pizza here a few times but last time i did was terrible. i placed an order thru the app, said it would be about 45 mins. i was on a time limit and an hour and almost 30 mins had passed. i kept calling and calling and calling, no answer. so i emailed pizza hut directly and got 2 coupons 4 2 free pizzas. it was great but to wait an hour and a half 4 pizza? no thanks"
300,1,1,"My daughter and I went here with my beautiful 1y.o. grandson on Saturday afternoon and I cannot begin to tell you how great the staff is (two amazing young women with great attitudes and more patience than I have seen in a very long time) along with the establishment being a mix of sports and kid friendly AND the food being delicious! They were really gracious and kind enough to redo our pizza (at their insistence) at no additional charge-the BBQ chicken pizza is out of this world, we just did not notice on the menu it had bacon which neither one of us eats. They really did not know how much we appreciated it since my grandson was a bit fussy as he just had a check up and two vaccinations-and my daughter is a new mom:) I can honestly say they are added reason to love Union city! Thank you ladies, you made our Saturday=)"
301,2,2,Had to wait 30 minutes for them to take our order. And then they came back to ask us again what did we order...talk about horrible service hopefully the food makes up for it!!
302,2,4,My nieces & I went there one night on a Friday & the place was dead. It took about 10-15 mins for us to be seated first off. There was only 1 girl at the front answering phones & wouldn't even look at u when u first walk in. Finally we were seated & given menus the waitress didn't even ask us what we would like to drink 1st she just took our order & took our menus & the only reason she brought us drinks was because i had to tell her that we wanted to order them. The food came out too fast it was like they already had that food ready to throw out because it was bad!!! The food got to our table 1st than the drinks did! Then after we left we all got home with stomach aches! NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK THERE!!! This Pizza Hut seems like it's not a legit Pizza Hut because the food didn't taste like it normally does from them!!
303,2,2,"If I could give it 0 stars and a swift kick in the ass, I would. Would never order from them again as long as they are in business. The customer service, sucks. The store employees don't even answer the phone to confirm orders."
235,2,2,"HOW tf is this ""Pizza hut"" without any damn pizza,every damn day. This ""hut"" is pathetic and their workers are very lazy and disrespectful"
305,2,2,"The only reason why I'm giving this place one star is because I have to in order to write this review -_- this place deserves ZERO stars! Just got back from eating at this Pizza Hut and service was so terrible!!!! The waitresses don't do anything but stand around and be on their phones! My boyfriend and I ordered mozzarella sticks as Appetizers and a medium pizza. Well guess what? We got our medium pizza 40 minutes later but, no mozzarella sticks! Oh wait? Weren't the mozzarella sticks for appetizers? How long does it take to fry mozzarella sticks??! The waitress then tells us "" oh I was just waiting for the mozzarella sticks to come out before I gave you the pizza"" uhmmmm, aren't appetizers suppose to come out before the pizza? Of course I said ""I don't want the mozzarella sticks anymore"" then, as my boyfriend and I were eating, she comes back and says ""oh you want a box for what's left over?"" Mind you, we have like 3 slices left and my boyfriend had a slice in his hand and I did as well. Then 15 minutes later she brings the check? Umm aren't you going to ask if we want dessert? Of course not! About 3 families left upset and mad  when we were there! This guy even complained to them and the waitresses would go back to their little corner and laugh!  I swear, I'm never coming back here! And of course, we didn't leave a tip!!!! DO NOT COME TO THIS PIZZA HUt!!!!"
306,2,2,"Wow, what an awful awful experience yesterday for Super Bowl Sunday.  Been to this place many times to do takeout since it's just out of reach for delivery.  Service is generally late or delayed at normal times but it was bearable.  Yesterday though, it would have been better if they closed down because it would have save all the headaches for all their customers and save all the labor cost.I order my pizza online at 3pm for pickup at 5:30pm.  Ordered large supreme pan, pasta, breadsticks and fries.  Showed up at 5:35pm.  Seems ok since I was maybe one of 5 or 6 people there.  Give them my name, they say they are working on it.  Expected so I waited.  At 6pm, I gave them the push and ask them about my order, according to the person at the desk, they burned a bunch of pizza (lying?) so they are totally backed up.  By this time, there are now 15 to 20 people waiting.  They want to cancel my order since they said it'll take another hour.  I told them what is the fastest they can get my order done since I'm one of the earlier one there.  30 minutes.  I told them I'll wait.  In the meanwhile, the wait time for delivery is now 2 to 3 hours.  They are totally rejecting eat in customers at this point.6:30pm, they called my name, I expect my order done so I can leave.  They brought out the pizza, I saw it wasn't exactly what I order (Supreme) since it's missing a few toppings but I just want to get home with something at this point so I moved on.  I asked about my pasta, the cashier gave me a surprised face, ""let me check"".  F u c k...  They didn't cook it.  She wanted to take it off my order (.............mind blown, of course you should if you don't have it but where is my order?).  On one of the busiest day of the year, you sell two types of pasta and you don't have a bunch prepared?  What kind of operation is this? Ok.  So where is my breadsticks,  ""let me check"".   F U C K..........  Unbelievable.  ""We don't have any breadsticks at the moment.""  ""What, you don't have a huge pile of breadsticks in the back?""  What in the world.  My 3-year old can do better than this. So they gave me the pizza and the fries.  Fries that were ready at 5:30 and is now soggy.  I didn't have the energy to bother with it any more.  I just paid and got out and wanted to leave them to all the other angry people waiting in line.  I'm sure my kid will eat anything at this time since its late.When I got home, I found out my pan pizza is really a stuff crust pizza and minimal amount of toppings under better lighting.  The pizza looks like it was a medium instead of large.  So they can't even get one thing correct.  Well, they did, they got my fries correct.  Which are now cold and soggy and unedible.  I lost all mood to watch the game and had everyone eat some quick food that we heat up.  Worst freaking ordering experience ever out of years of ordering takeout and delivery.  Will not come back to here.  To sum up, on the busiest day of the year, they had 5 or 6 cashiers in the front, and maybe more than 10 in the back with who knows how many drivers.  The delivery part, I understand that you could mess up.  Burning an oven full of pizza shouldn't put you back any more than 20 minutes.  And it doesn't take 6 cashiers no matter how busy the place is to do the job correct let alone to do everything wrong.  Everyone customers and employees was literally staring at each other not knowing what to do.  I work at a place when I was younger that is just as busy, I could do the job at the desk with just two employees if it is done correctly.  It seems like the cashiers were totally at a loss and can't manage the queue at all.  They are all dumber than any cashiers that I have ever come across.I'm disputing the charge on my credit card."
307,2,2,Very disappointed bad service the servers were very nasty. They gave us a chicken wings without sauces.
308,2,4,"Came here because it was getting late and we were hungry, and wanted to get into the city after getting a bite to eat.. just got done driving 12 hours. Parking was easy, thats the only reason it got one star. I ordered garlic chicken wings, and the wife ordered a small pizza and some bread sticks. Our drinks came out right away, then we were forgotten about.. 15 minutes later I recieved my cold chicken chunks with some garlic sauce poured over them. about 10 minutes later the wifes pizza came out.. 10..20..about 25 minutes later the waitress forgot about the breadsticks. They were at least hot. Timing of the food was BAD. When you want to eat some wings and pizza together, dont eat here."
309,4,2,"#My friend and I were excited to eat Pizza Hut. We haven't had it in a long time. We grew up on this stuff in the 80's. But sadly, I guess Pizza Hut makes their pan pizza differently now. The #crust is different. It doesn't seem like it has that crustiness or flavor as if it was cooked in an oily pan. It's hard to tell from this photo of my mine though, because this is #pretzel crust. But the other pizza we had was regular crust and it almost looked like a non-pan pizza.Okay, my above gripe isn't this location's fault. But I will blame them for forgetting the #Sriracha swirl I ordered on it. Plus the delivery guy didn't want to ring our buzzer. He wanted us to come out to his car on the street. So I explained this to my friend so he would go down and get the pizza, saying the driver was a #dick. Then I realized we never hung up the phone call."
310,2,2,"Waited 2 hours for a simple delivery, one personal pan pizza, breadsticks, and a stuffed crust pizza, once the driver gets here, he's missing a personal pan we ask to see the receipt, the PERSONAL PAN PIZZA was deleted off the ticket, no phone call, nothing, completely unacceptable."
311,2,2,"I decided to eat at this Pizza Hut because the one on Myrtle is shut down & I had a good coupon.. The delivery wasn't able to reach to my house (16 minute drive) so I met them at a closer location which I didn't mind. BUT the wings were dry af, the pizza was completely soft and didn't have the garlic buttery blend crust I always get on my pizza & the marinara sauce was completely watered down. This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever ate & I'm wondering why the Myrtle location was shut down when this location should've been ‍ I'm 19 years old and don't do reviews but this Pizza Hut was so disappointing I had to. I don't suggest anyone to order from this location."
312,2,2,"My food was cold & I live 5 minutes away.... I wasn't feeling well so I decided to order in, & was very disappointed. The Marinara sauce was straight from the fridge. The delivery driver sat in his car outside my house for almost 10 minutes before delivering my food. He was very rude. Wish I could've tipped him after this awful delivery."
313,2,2,"If I could get 0, I would.I ordered delivery last week while watching my 1 year old daughter in my apartment building since it is a hassle to travel with a baby.  The delivery guy refused to deliver to my apartment even though I told him my situation over the phone as we argued. We have never had any issues with any other delivery service.   The delivery guy was just being incredibly lazy and rude. He forced me to come down or not get the food at all.  I had to come down with my daughter in hand to pick up the food. Was a total enjoyment to carry my daughter back up stairs while holding a pie of pizza.....  I have no regrets for not leaving a tip after this interaction. Food itself was pretty uneventful and lukewarm as well.  Last time I order from here."
314,2,2,Just ordered here today for the first time I asked for honey bbq wings for me and pizza for my friends( keep in mind the delivery guy got a $10 tip). They said okay and when I got the the order they gave me spicy wings. I called them back and the manager said they only have mild or spicy wings which they did Not say on the phone honey bbq is spicy . ...Wth?! ... I said How Is Honey Spicy??? He said we can give you credit and I said I didnt have anything to eat all day i just want my wings ..can you send me mild and I'll give u back the spicy. He said the delivery guy is to busy. I'm hungry and can't eat the pizza my friends ordered bc I'm allergic to cheese..Finally he said he will bring the wings and they never came!!!Fire the manager that worked Aug 5th 2018 during the 5:30 time! He doesn't deserve to be called a manager! Zero stars if I could!!! NEVER AGAIN
315,2,2,"The ""Manager"" was rude and obnoxious on the phone , called us liars . The pizza that was sent to us was incorrect and the tomatoe sauce was expired cheese wouldnt even stick to it ( work in the restaurant industry at a high level so able to tell these thing) end results the kids got sick and almost ended up at the ER for food poisoning. instead of being courteous and professional they decided to ignore our problem and sent us on our merry way. we have now reached our lawyer and will be pursuing actions.all of that because the staff wasnt trained in customers relations.... its a shame because its going to cost them much more than having sent back a proper one. Good job Pizza hut of fresh pond road. see you in court :)"
316,4,2,Ordered take out...guys in the store weren't overly friendly or anything and basically waited for me to say something before I was helped...pizza was too well done and not as good as usual. Disappointing
317,2,1,Was told to pick up my order in 20 minutes. Entered the store 5 minutes early and my food was ready!Thank you for really cold large pie pizza.Thank you for 3 of the slices missing a lot of toppings.Thank you for lack of cheese.Thank you for burnt black chicken wings.Thank you for not adding hot sauce as I ordered.I'm mostly thankful for the cashier not bagging my food and watched me bag it.Please do not mess around and have conversations (3 employees including the manager) when there's a long line of customers especially in front of the register area. Looks very unprofessional and as if your store is a slacker.I would not hire any of the employees there if they were to apply at my company. Harsh but must be said after my annoying experience today.
318,2,2,"Ok so I'm a Pizza Hut fan, when I heard that there was one on fresh pond road I said ""move a side Boston Market"". Some locations are not made to represent a company and this store is one of them. I arrived and ordered a veggie personal pie. The store was combined with KFC  I don't understand how this place is still surviving.  When you don't have that many stores open I feel the customer service should be outstanding.  I called and spoke to crystal about Paul Joshua who made a mistake in my order.  Instead of an apology I got excuses and attitude. I was upset but I blamed my self I should have spent my 27$ at Boston Market."
319,2,2,"called to ordered food for delivery. after taking my order, the guy asked for my address and tells me ""nope you're too far"" meanwhile I've ordered from here plenty of times before. I only live 10 minutes away. he was rude to top it off. the customer service is horrible. never ordering from them again! I'll go somewhere ""closer"" because they're lazy"
320,2,2,"Service is absolutely horrible. They never get the orders right, they charge for delivery, and the delivery person has been known to honk his horn out side of homes, and expect the people to go to the car for the food. The place is filthy dirty. And the appearance of staff is sicking. I give this place an F and the doors should be locked by the city health department...."
321,2,2,"If these assholes could sell raw brownie dough they would. I ordered for pickup and they told me it would be ready between 10-12 minutes. I got there in 17 and expected the brownies to be ready, only to find out they weren't. That was ok though. I get home to indulge and as I'm prying the pieces apart I realize the brownies are way too gooey and that the dough is practically still raw. Now I have to put it in the oven myself and wait to eat them. Very careless staff."
322,2,2,"Staff is ok  The overall appearance of this place is dirty filthy disgusting floors are filthy black, soda machine is always overflowing with ice, tables and chairs unsanitary and wait time for food is ridiculous"
323,2,2,"I placed an order today 2- 8 piece wings (simple.. So you would think) . The order was placed at 1:34pm on the Pizza Hut app- confirmation specified the order would be delivered at 2:04pm not 2:15-not 2:34... The pattern that THIS particular location has consistently shown is inconsistency. Why every time I place an order the service gets WORSE ... the employees sound like we make their ears bleed when a customer is dissatisfied- ( I'm sorry that's what happens when you're not effective at your job) FIND ANOTHER ONE THAT MAKES YOU SMILE :) I called and immediately cancelled the order. I told the employee the customer service is poor and lazy. And it's tiring to put up with this : you do this pretty much each time Pizza Hut. He didn't care, didn't apologize and asked, "" what's your number to cancel?"") in one ear and out the other smh. The driver called with my order as I was hanging up and I politely told him "" you can turn around, the order has been cancelled "". Dear PH- Don't think you're going to walk up my steps with LUKE WARM WINGS 30 mins late. BISH where ?! I like my wings fresh and crunchy. Not cold, LATE. & wet. I work in the customer service industry. I deal with the shit too but don't fuck with my food. Because you'll be damned if someone fucks with yours. :)"
324,2,2,"Ordered one afternoon, called back 40+ mins later still waiting for my pizza, and they said they couldn't deliver it because I lived too far?! Couldn't have said that when I placed my order? Plus, they have delivered to my address before. What a joke."
325,2,2,This happens a lot where you order 10 or more and either they miscounted or just deliberately short you of two pieces of the chicken I don't trust this place.
239,4,2,"I finally found a pizza that both my wife and I  like.Do you know what we don't like?Thievery and fraud perpetrated by the workers.Every time, that is, EVERY time we use the app to order, we pay the price listed but there's ALWAYS something missing.It's like you have to AUDIT your own order every...single...time.Especially when you order the stuffed crust or Cheese Sticks at Ave D Pizza Hut.That's right, I'm calling you out, criminals!I shouldn't hVe to check my order because the workers SEE the order from their app before they give it to me!WTF, Pizza Hut? Do you do a background check before you hire them?It wasn't once, it wasn't twice, it's every...single...time.So, my conclusion: good pizza, but felonious employees. Always, Always check your order before leaving.And those little ""Pizza Hut Express"" places? Avoid them like the plague. -Not- the same quality pizza"
327,2,2,Where do I begin worst unprofessional staff and to top it off told me my order would be done in 20 minutes which turned into 50minutes never again 2nd time here and the same thing make you wait forever ‍ never ever again if you have a hour to waste waiting for pizza I recommend this place
328,2,2,"Upon my better judgement I attempted to order again years later, and this time my order just never came. And when i called multiple times to even check on the order or cancel it I was ""transferred"" to another line that no one ever answered and eventually just hung up."
329,2,2,"****YOU'VE BEEN WARNED****We placed an ordered. Didn't get it until 2 hours later and it was COLD not even cooked all way. To add insult to injury, there a few items still missing. My boyfriend and I spent  the next hour and a half on 2 different phones trying to speak to the mgr of the store. A representative would come to the phone after 20-30 mins of being on hold... Oh I forgot to mention we called 9x! We asked every time to speaking to a mgr and were told that we would need to be transferred. ""Transfered"" the phone will ring and then hang up. Just to recap, THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAPPENED 9x!!!We tried the delivery guys cell phone number hoping this would help. It did, so again we asked if we would speak speak to the mgr. I guess by then the gentleman was already back at the store and he handed the phone to the the mgr Nyema. FINALLY getting a helpful person on the phone. The result of all of this was that the mgr was able to refund the money back. After expressing the disgusting customer service, we were asked if we wanted a store credit! Ha, absolutely not!  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PIZZA HUT. Horrible customer service!"
238,4,1,My son likes it so I can't say much.  It's an Express Shop in the Target here.  They seem to follow Target everywhere.  No long line today at least.
331,2,2,WORST Pizza hut ever. 2 hours+ for our delivery. Pointless/useless customer service person answers to transfer me to a manager that never answered.
332,4,4,"One of my guiltiest pleasures. You can not go wrong with their Supreme pizza and Breadsticks with extra seasoning. I decided to try their new Hut Favorite Flavor Sticks-- classic breadsticks with a garlic buttery twist. It was pretty good but I'll be sticking to the classic. The upgraded version was a little too salty.This location has been consistent for years. Food is made fresh and is always exactly what I ordered. Id recommend takeout. Can't speak on delivery but their seating area is limited. One downside, they now charge for extra seasoning on the breadsticks."
333,2,2,"Ordered via the Pizza Hut app: 9:35pmStated estimated delivery time: 10:04pmCalled to follow up: 10:17pmPhone rep stated driver had already left.Received call from driver: 10:41pmOrdered 1 stuffed crust pie, 16 wings, and the Chocolate cookie pie.Chocolate cookie pie was not warm when received. Since it came in a foil tin, we popped it in the oven as we ate so the cookie pie will be warm when it's time for dessert.Main complaint: Length of waiting time and room temperature cookie pieWill I order from here again? Most likely yes. Why? Because it is the only Pizza Hut in my area that will deliver to my house, and Pizza Hut commercials do a fantastic job making me crave them. I'll just have to keep in mind that I am going to have to WAIT."
334,2,2,"Usually don't have a problem but this was ridiculous. Been traveling all day back from vacation and decided to pass on food at the airport because we wanted to get pizza hut at home. Delivery took well over an hour and when finally got our food, the big dinner box, the pasta was completely overturned on one of the pizzas. We called to complain and see if we could get another order sent, was told no it's too busy and we'd only get credit for a later order. Completely unprofessional and the delivery guy definitely sold the pizza box and acted like it didn't happen. Won't order from here ever again, I'd rather go with dominoes."
335,2,2,I have placed an order online at 8:54pm and was supposed to receive my order at 9:25pm! I waited and called the store at 9:55 pm which I spoke to someone and the young lady said it on its way I asked how long she said wait another 15 mins ... its 10:30 and I still have not receive my food I find this ridiculous and poor customer service. Called the 1-800 number and that was pointless will never order from this location again!
336,2,2,2 hours and 40 minutes for cold pizza and stale fries. 2 hours just to make it and 40 minutes to deliver it. The place is only 2 miles away so it should've never taken that long. Ridiculous
330,2,2,Found a long grey hair in my p'zone. Disgusting. I pulled it out thinking it was a strand of cheese and then proceeded to feel nauseous when I realized it was actually a hair and I had almost finished the p'zone.
338,4,4,"I had a bacon and cheese stuffed crust pizza. The cashier didn't understand what I was trying to order. It took her about 5 times to get it right. Afterwards, the pizza was completely soggy. However, it still tasted good so that was a plus."
339,2,2,"Noooo, no no no, don't waste your time and money. Hour and 30 minutes wait for them to deliver the worst pizza ever. It's not even worth the one star."
340,2,2,"BEWAREI will never order from this Pizza Hut again. I placed my order online and received a completely different order.  I called the manager and he had a horrible attitude.  After placing me on hold, he still couldn't find my order.  His excuse for the mistake was ""my driver is new and stupid"". why would you say something like that about your worker?  I should have seen the Yelp reviews before my order.  Must I say the worst SERVICE EVER. The manager didn't offer me a discount on the pizza or anything.  SO I kept the other order and might i say thank you for the extra wings and pizza.  I'm sure the person missing their order will be on Yelp tonight saying the same things.  Note to Pizza Hut... Fire that male manager and burn the whole building downJust called back to Pizza Hut and told them to pick this order back up. IT was COLD and undercooked.  I WILL NEVER AGAIN! Refund my MONEY...."
341,2,2,"1 hour 45 minutes for barely warm pizza??? This is the norm for this Pizza Hut and has made me never order from them again even ordering a pizza at 3pm results in their ""90 minute minimum wait for delivery, ok?"" warning when calling in my order. No! It's not ok."
342,2,2,"Sometimes you are just in the mood for Pizza Hut pizza, but I would never order from here again.  It took 1 hour and 20 min for my food to come.  And when I called 45 minutes into waiting, the girl said he should be there soon, however he took another 30 minutes.  My food was cold :-( Also, just a side note they include a delivery charge."
343,2,2,"The people who work in this establishment should not be allowed to work without proper training in Customer Service or People Etiquette.I just placed an order online at 8:08 PM and a message prompt said my order would be delivered in 45 minutes. I then received an email with my order confirmation stating I would have my delivery by 10:18 PM. So I placed a call to the store to get an explanation why I was getting 2 different stories. A woman  answered the phone, I greeted her and introduced myself. Then I proceeded to inform her of my situation. I wasn't done with the 1st sentence and she started to talk over me. I paused and asked if I can finish but she kept on talking over me asking me for my address. It seemed like she was programmed to ask and say just that ""what is your address"". I asked her if she could hear me and understand me. Classic, she either muted the phone or just put it down. I called right away to CS to cancell my order and to complain. Other than the attitude, I now have to wait for them to refund my money. Now I remember why my other family members stopped ordering from them years ago."
337,2,2,My order came 45 min later than the expected time. Pizza was dead cold. I regretted I order from that location.
345,2,2,"I'm not beyond eating at a Pizza Hut!But I am beyond stale bread. I'm not sure if the dough they used was stale or if it's because I haven't had Pizza Hut in a while, but it too more than enough effort to get the slices separated from each other. I don't mean to knit-pick and I know all you have to do is pull it apart, but fresh pre-sliced bread comes apart effortlessly. The taste was off as well. On the bright side? A large STUFF CRUST MEAT LOVERS SUPREME with jalapenos was only $12.  I guess that's a deal, right?Last word: Next time I crave Pizza Hut I'll order from a Pizza Hut with a higher turnover rate. Or maybe I'm expecting too much of a Pizza Hut? Que sera, sera."
346,2,2,"The Driver was nice (the only reason for a single star). The Large pizza was clearly a medium in a large box and the dough wasnt fully cooked properly. I called back to be put on hold for five mins, they are busy. I spoke to a employee who handed the phone to a Rude manager who doesnt greet me at all. Instead he says ""we sent you a large, that is a large"" ""you want me to make you a pizza myself ill do it"" as if it is my fault. this location has changed for the worst. This isnt my first bad experience however it will be my last.1. Poor food quality 2. Poor Mangment Pizza hut like other chains train employees and this manager needs retraining (in guest interaction)"
347,2,2,just got my order..pizza is hard like cardboard and pasta smells like moldy cheese..this location needs to be shut down ...
348,2,2,I will never order from here again. Waited for.my original order for over an hour. Then when it gets here the pizza isn't fully cooked in the middle. Nothing but mushy dough under the cheese. I call back and they agree to make me another one. Then I have to eat over an hour for the second one. This one gets here and although more cooked than the last one still not completely done in the middle. Thank God my kids eat the topping before they eat the breading other wise they would have been so sick. I try to call back and spend 20 minutes listening to the phone just ring. Its 8 o'clock they don't close til 11. Finally the same girl picks up and I'm irate. I want a refund. She says she has to call the driver to bring the pizza back so I can get a refund. It is now almost 9 o'clock and still no sign of him. They have lost me as a customer for good!
349,2,2,Ordered a Large Ultimate Cheese pie & 16pc boneless garlic parmesan wings. Took 2 1/2 hours for delivery service. During multiple calls to find out status of delivery my calls were disconnected. When my food arrived everything was COLD! Another call was placed to inquire about a refund or picking up HOT food I was told I can only receive store credit on the phone number I was calling from. HORRIBLE service! Pizza Hut on Rt. 440 is WAY better!
344,2,2,"Went in the store after my order was messed up and the manager did not want to fix it and I see this 4'0"" tall elderly woman who is incapable of being a manager well she still wanted to give me a hard time so I called corporate in her face and she walked away plzzzzz fire that woman asap. Pizza Hut is not what it used to be they will hire anybody smh."
351,2,2,"Do not! I repeat do not  call and order from this Pizza Hut. You never received your Pizza. I had the misfortune of calling this Pizza Hut and placing an order that never came. When I placed my order I was told it would take 30 minutes. I called back nearly an hour later and was told the delivery guy left 30 minutes ago. I only live 10 minutes  away. Nearly 3 hours later when I called yet again, I was told that I never placed an order when I know that I did and had 2 witnesses. This pizza hut is horrible. I will no longer be ordering from them."
352,2,4,"I went here for lunch today with a co-worker.  I had the personal pie she had breadsticks, and we both ordered a soda.  Cheap and simple right?  The bill came at $13.98.  My friend put down $5 bill and a $1 bill to cover her portion, and I layed out a $10 bill and a $5 dollar bill which totaled $21 dollars...are you with me?  My intent was to receive change so I could leave a 3 or 4 dollar tip.  The waitress never came back to return my change.  I had to ask her to bring it....then she proceeds to drop of a $ 2 dollar bill and 2 cents.  WHAT?  Where is the $5 to total $ 7 dollars owed to me in change?  I asked at the front counter and SHE rather the waitress and the girl working the register said that I did not give them a $5.  That I only gave them a single and then $15, which is an outright lie.  I told them that someone either took my $5 or they lost it in the drawer.  They proceeded to argue with me saying that they did not take it and they counted the drawer and it is not over.  I asked to speak to a Manager at that point which there was no Manager on site for the day.  They gave me his phone number and said to call him then in the morning, he will be in.  I intend to do so and at this point it is about the principle!  I hate wating my time fighting over stupid stuff like this with a restaurant or anyone for that matter, but I KNOW and my co-worker KNOWS what amount of money we left to pay our tab.  So since most likely, the waitress stole my $5 dollar bill, she got $0 for a tip.  I think $ 5 dollars is a great tip for a $ 13.98 tab.  DO NOT ENTER THIS ESTABLISHMENT UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR MONEY STOLEN.  GHETTO, DIRTY, GROSS, AND THIEVES WORK THERE."
326,2,2,"Where do I begin.....For the last 2 years I have lived on this side of Jersey City, and everyone in the West Bergen section knows that food eatery options is very limited. So here we have Pizza Hut....First, never order delivery!! Always take out if you want this food. Delivery takes FOREVER and in addition, the your rolling the dice with the food. I have had times when the food came extra soggy and disgusting or burnt and dry. At least with pick up, you can check the food to make sure it is ok or have them make another. Sometime you think by ordering Pizza Hut, you would get a deal or Promo pizza but no, the cost for the pizza always comes expensive. It is as if the staff just does not care, but in their defense, this is fast food pizza so I am sure there is but so much they can do with the food but follow the cooking guidelines. I recommend that you just stay away to be safe but if you really need the Pizza Hut flavor, order bread sticks and a personal size pizza."
304,2,2,"Honestly the pizza there is just plain horrible, service is a nightmare and everything there was just a tragedy, should I even give them stars? Of course not."
350,2,2,This place is HORRIBLE they get your internet orders wrong! How is that possible? Then another hour waiting for delivery because they messed up! I let them know 2 hours is un except able they offer a free pizza really? 2 hours later for a half a meal no I want my money back... The driver was nice the only reason for 1 star.
