1,1,1,"Though Lori L. and Yan T. will be apt not to believe me, I only checked in here by accident while looking for directions to this location; I am a woman and, therefore, needed a restroom at the time, STAT.I can say, however, the interior is extremely well-maintained. Dare I even say it's ""pretty""?I used the restroom, but not before I knocked, heard no answer three seconds later, entered, and two gentleman were in said bathroom. One was leaving while zipping up his pants. He very matter of factly informed me that his friend was on the way out, but I could go in and use the toilet if I needed to.I...waited.Next time, I'll buy a small order of fries to combat my ""I used a 'customers only' bathroom without paying"" guilt. ...and that is my story. I hope you enjoyed it."
5,2,2,The 1 star is a mistake they don't deserve that. They can't never get your order right . Buns always hard and old. And they always forgetting something. I don't know why they open and customer service stinks their. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here. Unless you homeless and have no other choice BUT TO EAT !!! NASTY NASTY NASTY please CLOSE DOWN NOW !!!close down.
6,2,2,With out a doubt the worst run Mackers Iv ever been to. No one cares and the people who look/act like managers are as useless as the rest. They seem almost proud of their lack of care ! And struggle with the simplest of orders
7,1,1,"Management has changed, they are making efforts. Naomi take care of my fries real good."
9,2,2,Worst McDonald's  ever! Staff hanging around on their cell phones talking. Never again!!
3,2,2,"There is a McDonald's located on Dabney Drive in Henderson North Carolina. They are consistently horrible in their service. I was at the drive-through waiting to order on the outside lane. They processed three people through on the inside lane, at which point I decided to hell with it. This particular location has been shitty for many years. Even decades."
11,2,2,Horrible cold food and half cooked fries and it's expensive for the cold crap they sell
12,2,2,Ummm... yeaaaaah this place is just horrible these employees in here always have an attitude why the hell are you having an attitude working here? Just QUIT!!! I never understand why people come to work like that and have a bad day on you everyday I just don't get it. A NEW STAFF IS NEEDED!
13,2,2,"Oh what a pity. I mean, I should be lucky to have a McDonald's just a block away from where I live. Lots of memories as a child going to this happy place. Too bad memories fade especially when you have a McDonald's like this. First off, I give it 2 stars all based on the  food. I've never had a problem in the 6 or so years it's been open with the food here. It's just the little annoyances around the food that irk at my core. This place attracts sick people. Literally. The hospital is down the block and there's also a methodone clinic close by. Having this patient action around can lead to pathogens on tables and chairs and counters. Not to mention the nodding out that happens in the a.m. This McDonald's is also close to a train station and so it attracts many people to and from work. Mornings are the worst here. Long lines with 1 or 2 registers open. Unwelcoming. People taking your order but fulfilling it at different times. Still frozen hash brown. Nodding individuals. What they should have is a Coffee Only line. Take note. Not to mention the LOUD screeching/scratching of their chairs getting pulled out from under tables. The noise is almost deafening and the worst to endure at 7, 8, 9 a.m. or anytime of day really. Then you have to deal with the lingering of middle schoolers and the lunch breaks of neighboring employees. Even longer lines with still just 2 registers open. And later in the evening expect more chaos with kids who won't go home after school, who stick around and curse and laugh up a storm. As well as the Chinatown crowd who is still in shock over the closing of the Canal Street's location. Be prepared for possible panhadlers here as well. They all come here. The bathrooms are well-maintained here though. A certain lady has been doing it for years but since I live relatively close, I'd stick to my own. What this place needs is an enema. An intervention of the Gods to sift, cease, and refine. Again, the food here is great. It's McDonald's, you know what to expect. But this location has put it's ambiance on the back burner and that's not the McDonald's that I want to continue to know. Good Luck!"
14,2,2,"When this McDonalds first opened it was clean and always packed with customers. Tonight I was in there and ordered a filet-o-fish meal which cost me over $8 and by the time I got home (literally down the block) my food was cold. Not only that, I put it in my toaster oven to heat it up a little and the cheese didn't even melt!  not to mention the fish was hard. There were 3 employees plus the Mgr..who was the one prepping the food. Service was slow and they skipped my order 3 times. Health department needs to pay a visit and even after that..SHUT IT DOWN!!!! In the morning/afternoon hours this place is filled with addicts. Some eating some just hanging out. I've said it before but this time I mean it. I'll never order or eat food from here again...."
15,1,1,"Every few months I get a McDonald's craving. Just came here for a quick fix. The fries were perfectly cooked and really, that's the most important craving to satisfy. The filet-o-fish party was smaller than I remember but I think that's a corporate problem not this particular franchise. Management and staff operated efficiently during a busy lunch hour and waited only 5 min for my food. One of the better locations I've been to."
16,2,2,"Place is dirty, customer service is non existence, bad food, slow service, the list goes on and on.. You get the idea. It's just a dump overall.. Stay away."
17,2,2,This place is bad service and cashiers always have attitude. Always give you a dirty look.
18,2,2,The food is horrible.  It is worse than at other McDonald's stores.The bread they use is always stale. The service is lousy.. The management is rude.
19,1,1,Can't find fault with my visit here. Service was good; not a long wait. The place was being kept clean. And my burger (the new bacon club) even came out looking like the picture. That hardly ever happens!
20,2,2,"i would give it 0 stars if i could. ige been to alot of mickey ds and this is the worse forget bad service im from ny i can deal with that. lets talk about the hashbrown they threw into the bag with no wrapper, and the chicken nuggets i got that had pieces of hard white plastic in all of them??!! wtf it's not like i hard high expectations for mcdonald's but at least usually it's edible and not gross and seemingly unsanitary. this place need some serious help jesus."
22,2,2,"Not a frequent McDonald's visitor, I hadn't been in one in years. This McDonald's was PACKED. The seating and restrooms were on the second floor, but getting to the stairs was like swimming up current. The hallway space was way too small and workers were unfriendly, busting their way through first.Food was the same anywhere else, the main reasoning behind my review was the atmosphere."
21,1,1,Needed breakfast working the 6am to 2pm shift. And was in the mood for sausage egg mc muffin. I haven't been in McDonald's in years. So I ordered a few mc muffins and hash browns.Order came out fast and was on my way. I had other choices for breakfast nearby but couldn't deny my mickie d craving.
2,2,2,"I've been to a lot of restaurants and this has to be the absolute worst. From the staff with no hairnets on and straggles of hair everywhere to the overflowing trash that greets you as soon as you come in, this place needs to be condemned. It's disgusting. The workers said the bathroom was out of order yet there was no sign stating such. The worker then said someone keeps taking it off and unlocked the restroom for me to use anything and it looked like ""American Horror Story: McDonald's"". They had a bunch of staff in the back yet no one seemed to have cleaned the bathroom or surrounding areas since the night before. It was deplorable. And then they had the audacity to smart to sell yesterday's apple pie to me! That thing was harder than the economy! The health department need to be here ASAP! And the workers are lazy as hell."
10,2,2,"SUCH bad service. It's a McDonald's so the food is as you can expect but out of all the McDonald's I've been to, this has the worst service I've seen which sucks since this is the one I live closest to.The interior is pretty clean and looks nice, which would have made my rating decent if not for the rude af cashiers. This wasn't limited to a single instance; I have been there multiple times and the cashiers were almost always incredible offensive, rushing you or calling you stupid or blind when you ask for clarification on the menu or drinks.Furthermore, the store always seems to be out. The ice cream machines are almost constantly broken and one memorable time, I was trying to buy drinks and almost everything was out (this lead to me asking what exactly there was and the cashier calling me blind, as mentioned above). There was another time where a cashier was yelling at an old man who was struggling to order. Yep, that made my opinion of this place go wayyy down.P.S. don't try to use the McDonald's app coupons at this place; the cashiers won't wait for you to show them the bar codes and when you do manage to scan it, they give you really judgey looks."
24,2,2,The McDonald's here is a total scam. Don't visit here. Outside it advertised that there was a student discount but I never got it even with my student ID. Then I gave the lady $15 on my $14 order and she said that I only gave her $14. I am appalled that she can't do math correctly. Either she can't do math or she just wanted to steal $1 from me. She didn't give me back change even though I demanded it. I even told her to check the security camera. She kept insisting that I gave her $14. That's so disgusting. She also gave me burnt chicken nuggets. Seriously this place is a scam and a total waste of time and money.
4,2,2,"This McDonald's a couple years ago, that African American (He's like a Teenager) messed up my order for no reason, I hate this McDonald's so much! Long time never been to that 213 Madison St because I've avoided this McDonald's a lot of time. I am going to have another review when I went to this McDonald's Again and see how good it is."
25,2,2,"This McDonald's at 52 Fulton Street, NYC is closed. The sign on front door says they couldn't afford the new rent increase."
23,2,2,"Worst I've been to. The staff is rude and do not listen, unapologetically take orders with attitude. The place is filthy. Garbage everywhere. The food was old and I am so mad I took it to go but I trusted it would be fresh, not sure why. My fries, even after asking for no salt on them, were not made fresh. The more expensive than in other boroughs fillet o fish was old and tasted like it had been sitting a while. The manger seems to be doing the work and they seem to be cleaning the tables with dirty rags that smell like old dirty mops."
26,2,2,"Just walked in right now. This store is 24 hours to serve customers and I just got rejected saying their closed. If the store is ""closed"" they should locked their doors and change your dining hours."
27,2,2,"I came here during my lunch break at work - meaning I am already short for time and given that this place is called ""fast food"" of course, I expect FAST service. That was the last thing I got on top of all of the problems that I encountered. It is safe to say that I probably won't be visiting this location anytime soon because while the food was good (the only reason this is a 2-star rating and not a 1-star) their customer service is repulsive.I visited at 12:30PM and since it is the lunch hour everywhere, you expect them to be fully staffed at this McDonalds and be working the register. They were holding up the line because they were arguing with another customer because of her preferred choice of payment!!! Not having the money to pay is one thing but choosing to pay with cash in exact change is another and at the end of the day, money is money.They ended up taking what she had (finally) and kept it moving. After 15 minutes of waiting in line to order and another 10 minutes to get my food, my lunch break was over and I ate my burger during my walk back to work."
28,2,2,"""No packets of mayonnaise or relish"" (Lies)Shitty overpriced McDonalds near Wall Street. Bad food, high price. Walk 0.5 miles to anywhere for better food.Assholes know they have this neighborhood by their balls for late-night eats. Overcharge and undersupply."
29,2,2,"After a long night of watching Michigan sports (WOLVERINES!) I really wanted a McFlurry. The person behind the counter said the machine was broke, but there were people eating soft serve so I think he was lying."
30,2,2,Do yourself a favor.....if you're like me and just love Brummer king fast food every once in a blue moon NEVER walk into this location. It's up the street for me and one day I decided to do the 4 minute walk instead of ordering and that did it for me. The staff is disgustingly rude.  The place is visibly dirty. I regret it. It may have ruined Burger King for me all together. Let alone my once a month cheat meal. I don't get it....I thought fast food employees were being paid $15 an hour now....shouldn't they care a little more? I know...it's just Burger King and I shouldn't expect much.
31,2,2,I came here for a quick hot chocolate before my interview. There was no lines but the service was slow and rude. There were a bunch of people who was just loitering there which made it hard to get a seat. I was able to grab a seat to enjoy the rest of my beverage but I had to wipe it down because it was filthy.
32,2,2,"Wtf??? I work around the corner and have attempted to order here several times. A) they never, NEVER AHAVE McFlurrys. B) I can't eat pork or red meat. Every other time I have asked for a hash brown, instead of a sausage, EVERY OTHER MCDONALDS has said yes. This has been the only place that won't accommodate people who don't eat sausage. As earlier stated, I work around the corner. This place would legit get my business a minimum of two times a week, if it wasn't for their AWFUL customer service."
33,2,2,This McDonald's is worst even if I love fast food they got my order wrong and called my obese father fat which is very turnings for him
34,2,2,Unfortunately All of employees are just idiots.They said $5 and $4.79 are same. They could not understand there is $0.21 differences.
35,2,2,"The absolute worst McDonald's in existence. Slowest service, stale/poorly cooked food and probably the lowest of the low staff. I avoid this place like the plague most of the time."
37,2,2,"Visited on Thurs, 5/3/18 around 4:45pm: worst experience for the first time at this fast food restaurant. The front counter lady who attended my order had serious attitude problem towards her CUSTOMER, by the way, I am a Chinese.  I hope she has no racial issues.  I don't know asking questions could be offensive and she showed no effort to offer help or further clarification in answering my queries.  On the other hand, she acted arrogant throughout the transaction.  I wonder did someone complain about this lady before me.  Looks like the staff in need of an in-depth-training and they require awareness about what FUNDAMENTAL CUSTOMER SERVICE is in order to maintain good reputation of McDonald's."
38,2,2,"I can't really avoid this place when I need a fast food fix, since it's the only McDonald's close to me, but the service and constant product malfunctions are a real turn off. I've been to this location 4 times and every single time there was something wrong.1. The payment processing machines were broken so they weren't accepting card at the time. (okay it happens)2. They weren't serving any McFlurries, Shakes, Ice cream, apple pies, or any other desserts.3. They took 30 minutes to make a batch of french fries.4. All of the seating areas were covered in trash and half eaten food.I mean, I'm not sure how much of this is due to the manager of the restaurant or a failure in supply chain logistics, but how can you have a restaurant that never serves a full menu?"
39,2,2,"They had absolutely horrible service it was the worst I've ever seen. The food took forever to get out and it was ridiculous I'll slow it took, it took like 20 minutes. It was like they knew how to do nothing."
40,3,3,Cool stuff hamburger guy texting with his latex gloves still on . The bread was very stale but the fries were surprisingly delectable.   The owner of this McDonald's really needs to do some surprise visits and a refresher at hamburger university.
41,3,3,"It's hit or miss. Sometimes the staff actually cares enough to make food quickly and sometimes they could not care less. Also, the crowd can get weird in here but I can't really blame McDonalds for that lol. Long as there's not too many people waiting for food already inside you have a good shot at getting decent service. It's mcdonalds, whatever I'll be back anyways."
43,3,3,The lunch crunch wasn't bad at all.  Very short wait for Shamrock shake
42,2,2,"This has got to be the most disgusting McDonald's I have ever patronized! I went to visit my husband at Columbia Presbyterian after surgery and he requested fries late in the night. We ended up tossing half of the order! The food was cold and stale like it had been sitting for hours. My burger tasted like old oil and the fried were limp, cold and dry. Too bad my order was to go or I would have argued for a damn refund! I wondered why I got my order so fast on a late night. What a horror! I will never... Repeat never... Eat here again! The cashier was carrying on a conversation and looked at me like I stole her puppy when I stood there waiting to be served. You also have to deal with homeless people harassing you for money because they opened the door for you. (Nothing against them but I'm hungry too!) My hubby and I did swear we were going to boycott McDonald's because the one in our neighborhood had fallen completely off (despite remodeling). I will be satisfying my late night cravings elsewhere from now on."
44,2,2,"I used to come here years ago and still come once in a while to this day. The place is cleaner but has a lot of wasted space even pre covid. Right now I'm surprised they haven't installed kiosks as the lines to place orders and pickup orders are very slow. The advertise using the McDonald's app to get deals and free delivery but the deals only work for pickup and the free delivery isn't free, the delivery opens up ubereats and you have to finish your order through ubereats."
45,1,1,It's McDonald's I mean if you're can get your food in time and it's not cold you're in good shape. Has worked with covid guidelines and is pretty fast. Works well with the app.
46,1,1,It always takes me back to a place where I remember I was concentrated on having fun (winter sports). I love their breakfast menu. And their price is so reasonable especially during the pandemic.Their hash browns haven't changed a bit. And that's why I like it.
49,1,1,"I was impressed that they were offering the same sales deals as the other McDonald locations in Brooklyn. From previous experiences many of them do NOT have the same sales. Plus, they are very up to date in Art all over the store- beautiful. The service was pleasant and the order took no time. Of course, my coffee was not the way that I requested, but I was able to fix it on my own. Fresh pot kept me silent. I'll probably revisit due to how close it is to my job and the fast service. I'm not sure if they have lunch specials too. Clean, fast service, clean restrooms and I'm a happy helper"
48,2,2,"Avoid this place at night, crime central, mentally ill, homeless.   Police called regularly."
50,2,2,"This McDonald's is just weird.The lines are unorganized and it feels a little bit like a madhouse in there. Maybe it's the random lady dancing like she's having a seizure in the middle of the store with her eyes half closed and rolling back. You know she's dancing though because her voodoo-seizure dance is on beat to the song they're playing. Maybe it's the creepy dude standing in the corner talking to himself and half yelling at other customers. It doesn't help that it's kind of dark in there adding to that creepy mood. To top it off, I braved the crazy all for the fries-- which were piping hot but were under fried and limp. Go for the crazy but not for the food."
51,1,1,"I have been to this location a few times during my New York City trips.  My visits here have been mostly during the after midnight hours, but I have visited here a couple times before midnight.  I find this McDonald's location to rank on the top half of my list of fast food restaurants in Manhattan.This location is unique from most other McDonald's in Manhattan because of its interior designs.  First, the inside has two floors, which is convenient, considering the high traffic in the area.  This makes me feel less overwhelmed with other customers rushing for their food, like a couple other McDonald's in Manhattan.  The after-midnight hours are less chaotic.  Second, the paintings and the photos of parts of Manhattan give the inside a more interesting flare.  These include parks, buildings, and street signs.  I never expected any McDonald's to have such an artsy feel to it.  This is refreshing because most other McDonald's that I have frequented feel bland.  This McDonald's does not.The employees seem to maintain the appearance well.  The inside looks cleaner during their after-midnight hours than any other time.  I do not expect the inside to look sparkling clean when there is a high level of traffic.  However, even during such times, the leftover food and particles left behind by the previous customers have never felt excessive.  Therefore, I have always felt comfortable walking and dining in here.The employees have consistently been friendly.  I have seen this friendliness to other patrons that I have observed.  They also seem to carry themselves well during their busy hours.  They are always quick and patient with customers.  This is a great quality to have, considering some Manhattan fast food restaurants do not have this consistency in customer service.  I deducted one star because sometimes, the wait times for my food have been excessive.  I understand that a high level of traffic also wants their food, but I have seen this long wait during their slow times also.  This could use some improving.  Otherwise, the food has always come to me hot and fresh, and it tastes delicious.  I usually order the cheeseburger or the quarter pounder meal.  I have been satisfied with both.When I am in this part of Manhattan and in the mood for a quick bite to eat, I will continue keeping this location in mind.  I will likely continue favoring the after-midnight hours over any other time of the day.  I feel like this is when I receive the best overall service."
52,1,1,"I love coming here after a long and tiring day, just so I can grab a quick snack. The location is pretty unique and a bit different from the MANY Mcdonalds I've been to. I think that the employees are able to keep up a good environment and they were able to keep it nice. The food was just like every other Mcdonalds I've been too nothing different and nothing special. I appreciate what they do because their service serves up to their name, which is ""fast food"". Overall, it's a good place to get a quick snack after tiring days of work!"
53,2,2,"I rarely eat at McDonalds or fast food first off. Things that annoy me at this particular location - the homeless at any point of the day try to open the doors for you and beg for tips and get angry if you don't tip them when they open the door. I don't even have to go in to eat to notice this going on when I'm walking around on my lunch break. I came in with a friend the other day because we were being cheap and I didn't feel like googling where there was food for under $10 in the area. I opted for naturally their happy meal which has totally changed since I was a kid. Or even 8 or 9 years ago. First off, the happy meal should have been on their $1/2/3 menu. It came out to like $4 - cry me a river. Holy *hit the kid's sized fries are like . . . . I don't even have words I was so dumbfounded. I think I got like 4 french fries in my cardboard box. Cheeseburger - two thumbs up. I should have just ordered that and effed my Little Bo Peep toy because what is she going to do aside from rot on my shelf till I give it to some kid? Option of a side of apples or go-gurt. What are you doing to me? After being dazed and confused on this new to me addition, I obviously went with gogurt because I can get unnatural tasting browned apples from the homeless people opening the doors. Maybe, this is more of a complaint with McDonalds in itself. I was confused on the soft beverage options because I'm used to soda fountains being out in the open for you to pour yourself so he just gave me a regular coke without asking me what I wanted. I don't like soda. Would have been nice to know my drink options. Four-year olds are lamenting everywhere. The sauce also isn't left out. But I think McDonalds did away with that years ago. There's nothing that devastates me more than when I can't just get an extra ketchup packet or ranch or sweet and sour sauce without being judged as a criminal. The most exciting part of my meal was my toy and the Stroopwafel McFlurry. Sweet jesus. So a new mcflurry or the shamrock shake is pretty much the only reason why I want to go to McDonalds for the record. But it was one of the most magical things I've put in my mouth since the Rollo McFlurry. Please for the love of god bring this back, Mickey D's. Okay, after having an interesting conversation about Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga and Tonya Harding with possibly another homeless man, I tried my friend's bacon and cheese fries. Two thumbs up. The portion size again is ridiculously small. Some people don't have problems with obesity in America. This makes me all really quite sad. The cheese sauce kind of tasted surprisingly good but the bacon tasted like bacon bits that you get out of a jar. I don't think I'd add bacon to anything from here period. Overall, it gets the job done. I felt uncomfortable and weirdly full after a very tiny meal which also makes me question what the hell I'm eating. Anyway, I've been to much better locations. Even Union Square does a better job at crowd control in their hub."
54,2,2,"McDonald's uses cruel practices for their chickens. This is not a ' happy meal'. These chickens are kept in battery cages and not even allowed to walk due to the amount of growth hormones they are fed. They are abused disgustingly.  If you want to read more about McDonald's cruel practices, look at this site: foodrevolution.org/blog/…  imnotlovinit.com"
55,2,2,"The front door at this McDonald's is under the control of aggressive vagrants, who act as if they own the place. They open and close the door, looking for tips.This is a borderline threatening practice, and don't be surprised if there is an incident. The vagrants are on friendly terms with the employees who come and go, so, amazingly, it looks as thought the practice is condoned there."
58,2,2,Don't expect much from McDonald's in terms of service or even food options. Only expect it to be cooked ...my food was not. Long story short.
56,2,2,Don't even bother coming here. They only serve fries at about 1 AM and later. They didn't even to help us and give us what we wanted. We weren't the only people in the restaurant trying to order food. Very poor management.
59,2,2,"Construction on sidewalk, rude employees. I asked for BBQ Sauce for my nuggets and the guys hands me one. Really ?  I asked for more and  when I said thanks I get ignored. If you don't like your job then stay in school and get another one."
60,2,2,Terrible service. Employees do not greet or speak to costumers. Open 24 hours but every time I've been here there was nothing ready. Manager didn't even greet costumers to let them know what was going on. I stood at the register for 20 minutes before anyone said anything. Ended up leaving with no breakfast before work.
61,2,1,"Since I go to school near this McDonald's, I've visited quite often. I myself never had an issue with them since they're typically in a decent mood and the ice cream machine is always working. However, about a week ago, I went alone to grab a quick bite, and while waiting for my meal, one of the managers started to compliment me. I had my earphones on so I smiled and awkwardly said ""thank you"", hoping he'd take a hint. I sat down on one of the tables, and during my 15 minutes there, he had come up to me twice to keep flirting with me. Each time, I kept my earphones on, awkwardly giggled and kept eating. However, it was such an uncomfortable experience, that I'm not eating at the McDonald's for a while - not alone at least. I rather just take the 10-minute​ walk to a nearby McDonald's that's actually nicer and no one makes me feel uncomfortable."
63,2,2,Horrible service. The manager who walks around with AirPods in is disrespectful and hits on woman... completely unacceptable...
62,2,2,"I used the mcdonalds app to place a mobile order but when I went to the restaurant to pick it up they ""couldn't find"" the order in the system and refused to give me my food or a refund."
64,1,1,A VERY BUSY McDsThey are fast!A well run store in a very busy part of the city.I am on a diet so I have my order made without mayo etc and it comes out quick with no hassle
65,2,2,"There wasn't a single table available.  What happened to good manners from.the customers. I recently just came back from the great state of Louisiana where as a women, there would always be a man willing to give up his seat for me. Not at this establishment. My feelings were hurt"
66,1,1,"I'd go here over the other nearby McD's as it is spacious; there are two floors. Good place to stop in after all the walking around FiDi, WTC, Wall Street, etc.They have a large TV display of orders as they're fulfilled, which is a first for me.Note we missed the DJ that plays here, mentioned in other reviews."
67,2,2,"They charge me McChicken for $2.49 that usually sell for $1 at other McDonald. When I ask them why $2.49, she said that is the price at this location. It was a rip-off."
68,2,2,Nasty Management.  I placed a mobile order. When i went to pick it up i realized the sandwich  i ordered wasnt in the bag. It was a dried up hamburger i stead. When the manager wa as  asked to assist with the order he became nasty and disrespectful.  I told him customers should be respected if they are being respectful he became event more out of line. I told him to cancel the order i didnt want anything from that McDonalds.   Nasty disrespectful!
69,2,2,"I feel bad for the people who work here.  There is clearly poor management.  Tonight the only person on the register was also making the drinks and the two people bagging the food were also making it.  I did a mobile order for 2 Iced teas, and I've been waiting for a half an hour."
71,1,1,No other options in this area for a breakfast except Pret A Manger. Hubby wanted something basic so we ended up here. Clean establishment and friendly workers. The space is 2 levels so you have plenty sit in options. It served is purpose for a morning pick me up.
72,3,3,This is the McDonalds that was on some TV show downtown.  A bit pimped out and usually has quite a few bums in front.  Service is adequate and my hash brown was perfectly cooked.  Bathroom is gross.
73,2,1,Took me about 27 minutes to get my bacon buffalo crispy chicken on a cold sandwich holder with no type of salf on the fries.
74,3,3,I frequent this restaurant a lot the one near the seaport is a lot cleaner and updated...this place needs a renovation. The food tastes like any other McDonald's. They are just to slow at night. Oh and did I say it need to be CLEANED UP.
75,2,2,This is median  fries?!  And their ketchup were always dirty....! I wish I can give this McDonal-1 star!
76,1,1,"This place gets 4 stars based on its comparison with OTHER McDonald's. It's standard fare, but the place is like a dressed up, fancy version! With live music! Pretty funny and random. It's also open 24/7. Last time I walked by it looked like it was closed for renovations. I hope they make it even grander! hahaha."
77,2,2,"Just too touristy for me.I always get an uneasy feeling when I walk into this McDonalds, and most recently, the noise from the McCafe blender was as loud as a Jet Engine.No lie, I couldn't hear the counter person because of the decibel level of this thing.   I've been in other McDonalds that have the McCafe set up, and none of them are this loud.  Change that thing out!  It's disturbing and annoying."
80,3,3,"For a McDonald's, this is a pretty nice one.Yes this is the Fancy McDonald's I've seen featured on Food Network and Travel Channel.I was a bit worried because I read some of the yelp reviews didn't mention the piano player or waiter service.On 12/5/2010, I took my boo here after we checked out the Museum of the American Indian.  I wanted to have a cheap date, so the golden arches is a destination in my itinerary. However, it was a bit out of my price range. Everything was about 30% more expensive than other McDonalds than I've seen.   A small hot chocolate was about $2.40!  Did inflation go up that fast while we were sleeping?   We declined to eat here because of the Disneyworld style pricing and we just sat here to warm ourselves before heading over to Chinatown.Things of note in case you wanted to know if this is still the Fancy McDonald's:There was no doormanThere was no table serviceThere was a piano playing lady upstairsThe employees wore fancy hats and uniformsThe prices match the ambienceThe ketchup packets are laid out kinda fancy in a display for your use vs a bin"
79,1,1,"Great food and service as well. The counter help was fast and swift on taking or order, and the behind the scenes people made it all come together in a few minutes."
78,2,2,terrible busy. very small restroom. Do not go here if you can prevent it.Bathroom line takes much longer than food.
82,2,2,"No outlets upstairs, the bathroom downstairs was restricted to handicapped individuals, the upstairs was packed and they refused to open up the remaining 75% of the seating available. What's the point of restricting seating and forcing people to stand when you have 10 more tables available? Guys restroom had one urinal so there was a line. Overall they have a poor setup that reflects they want people to buy food and leave."
81,2,2,Yeah this is by far the worst McDonald's I've ever been to in my life . Wait 20 mins on the line for them to say cash only instead of having a sign up saying it where I wouldn't have to wait on line and would know to leave . Says 20 mins to fix system takes about 25 mins to do so. Waited almost a hr for 2 mcmuffins . While waiting the store allows a cracked out guy walking around talking to himself bugging out while another person is doped out passed out on his box of Dunkin donuts and next to him is a guy coming down from coke drinking a coffee staring at everyone . Then as eating a homeless drug addict comes in and asks to buy her food all strung out . I didn't obviously but my friend fell for her shit and did . Then as I'm about to leave the crackhead guy bums a cigarette off me so didn't want to offend a crackhead and have him bug so gave him one . Never going there again. Place can suck a fat chod!!!
83,1,1,"I never thought I would review McDonalds.  5 stars for the service! I have been to real terrible ones where the service sux, and others where they would charge you for additional sauces.  The hiring manager must have a good eye and ear for ratchet candidates- every worker here is really nice. 5 stars"
84,2,3,McDonald's is McDonald's really but this place has the unique difference of having a live person playing music on a piano in the restaurant.  What I really didn't like about this location is that seating is terrible (at least when I visited).  They have 2 floors of seating with maybe a dozen seats on each floor but they are in an area with massive tourism so seating was non-existent when I visited.
85,1,2,"Yes, I am reviewing a McDonald's.. stop your judgments!  I come here basically every morning for an iced coffee because there aren't many alternatives along the way to my office and the iced coffee in our cafeteria bites the big one.  The lines are long, but they move pretty quickly.  Large iced coffee and a yogurt parfait for under $5?  Don't mind if I do!  My only qualm that may be slightly irrelevant, but I would like to complain about it nevertheless.  There is this ridiculous ""homeless"" guy that has been sitting outside for the last 2 months - he looks pretty clean and I've noticed his New Balances have changed twice.. you don't seem too poor to me, sir.  Also, you seem to be punctual enough every morning to show up outside Micky D's for extra cashola, so go get a job..kthx."
86,1,1,"When I worked downtown, for the most part this is where I would eat lunch. For me, it was the place to be seen. You got the stock ticker working, since Wall Street is right there. You got the Mickey D's version of Liberace, playing to his heart's content as you're downing a Royale with Cheese (and why Liberace never found a wife to support him I will never know. Same goes for RIchard Simmons). You even got the McDonald's Gift Shop on  the second floor (yes, a McDonald's with multiple floors) where you can buy a mini-Statue of Liberty with the McDonald's logo on it. Better yet, for cheapskates such as myself, the Dollar Menu is in full effect. I'm Loving it (especially if it's a dollar)."
89,2,1,Went there today. There was no fries & they don't even try! What's so good about the renovation if there's no fries? Gonna go to the one on Fulton instead
88,1,1,This place is amazing and one of a kind.There is a woman playing the piano and singing. The staff is wearing cool french style hats. Everyone was very nice. Check out upstairs too!A must see Mcds if you are in the area!
90,2,2,"Jesus, this place is worse.  First, the cashiers leave a lot to be desired in the ""basic intelligence"" arena.  I'm not even talking intelligent -- I'm talking proof of brain function.  I had to give my order about three times, which normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, but the order was so wrong even after going over it three times.My husband and I ordered two hash browns, an egg and cheese on a biscuit, and an egg, cheese and sausage on a biscuit, with an iced mocha for fun.  We got an egg and cheese, one hash brown, a biscuit with sausage and bacon (no egg, no cheese) and a cup of milk.  Seriously, a cup of milk.  I don't get it."
91,1,1,This mcdonalds is super busy but you get live pianoist that performs upstair while you are resting your tired feet from shopping at Century 21. Another good thing about this place are the free restrooms for girls and boys that moves ten time faster than starbucks restrooms. Totally recommend this place if you are in the area =)
93,2,2,"Probably one of the biggest and fanciest McDonald's I've ever been in, but it's all for show. The staff there is incredibly ghetto, loud, slow to take your order, and even slower to serve you. There is one particular female server there (very butch and usually yelling), who actually got into a fight with a customer who came in and wanted to use the bathroom because of something he did to her girlfriend outside work that resulted in a fight then as well. It was all just so trashy and obnoxious. I mean, yes, it's a McDonald's, but that doesn't mean customers should be subject to the...I'm not even sure what to call it, that is going on at this McDonald's. The floor and tables are ALWAYS very dirty. (Note: I came back a 2nd time with a friend, and the same girl was there, yelling really loudly. The rest of the employees seemed to be doing NOTHING. Literally standing there and doing NOTHING, and the place was a straight up mess). There is an upstairs, but you are not allowed up there (it's like, what's the f*cking point of having it then?).  I would recommend staying away from this place unless you have very low standards in atmosphere, customer service, and hygiene."
94,3,3,The only thing that makes this McDonalds different from other mcds is the piano lady  and better looking tables other then that there really is no differents.The bathrooms are small when compared to the number of seats in the place so if you have to use the bathroom during the height of lunch time. you're better off walking the two blocks to boarders.The staff takes the orders quick but make sure you look in your bag before you walk away because they mess up alot.
95,3,3,"Like the Crispy Chicken fingers, sometimes in a salad. There is no more doorman.  There used to be 'table' service where someone would set a place for you. I can't remember the last time I had someone do that. Do love their iced coffee. But the piano is still there. And some evenings I will stop by to sip some cofffee and listen. But in the evening the upstairs is closed. A few homeless will meander in so hold your breath and watch your fries."
96,2,2,"this mcdonald's, in the financial district, cracks me up for the following reasons: there's a news ticker with headlines above the food menua gift&souvenir shop --  heh hehan Orchid Room - wtf?!a baby grand piano (with an actual piano player showing up sporadically...so you can listen to mozart while eating that whopper)a doorman - just in case, you know, you can't open the door.'table' service (ha ha ha) (i think they got rid of this)lol and to top it all off the frickin' homeless come in here to chill, adding to the high class atmosphere and ambience you're supposed to be getting with your fries and big mac. heh heh heh...why i ask you?DISCLAIMER: nothing against the homeless.........."
99,1,1,This McDonald's is cool. Its decorated nicely inside and has someone playing the piano and singing.
97,1,1,"Do people really write reviews of McDonalds'? Well, this one has a piano so on occasion, this is a live music venue. The food is generally served minutes after ordered which must mean it is all very fresh due to the fact that inventory moves so quickly. The staff here wear brets - clearly influenced by the French as evidenced by their French Fries. I often notice that McDonald's employees from other branches come here to order lunch so clearly, this location is superior to others."
100,1,1,"This McD location was the most generous of them all when it came down to handing out the free McCafe iced Mocha during the Summer. I recall people charging at the employees and walking away with two hands full. Needless to say I was one of those TYVM. BTW, I said no whipped cream, spammit! Fine, I'll add a star for that kickass promotion."
101,3,1,"This McDonald's is known as the ""fancy McDonalds"" because they have piano player, a doorman, granite table tops, and table service. When I walked through the door my monocle fell out of my eye. I thought ""ohh my word, this place is even too fancy for me!"" Unfortunately, I was woefully under dressed, but they luckily had a tuxedo for me to borrow. As I proceeded up the gracious stair case I admired the imported granite tables, I was impressed to hear piano player playing the moonlight sonata and shit. We were seated quickly in the ""orchid room"". This room was so fancy it made the Palace of Versailles look like a mere Buckingham Palace. We choose the prix fixe menu consisting of four courses. The first course consisted of a breaded and fried chicken cutlets with a crisp batter. This was paired with a fine vintage Sprite. The second course consisted of frites presented artfully in red cardboard tube with a thick tomato like sauce. The main entree was an enormous sandwich consisting of two patties, pickles, lettuce, and a three layer bun. The ""special sauce"" included in this sandwich danced over my palate like a ballet. The somellier was helpful throughout this meal. He recommended Coca Cola to complement the complex flavors of our entree. The final course was a desert pastry. It was a crisp and cinnamon apple flavour pastry not unlike those found in the finest bakeries of Paris. Over all this restaurant was the definition of dining excellence, and sophistication.The above is pure fiction. This in all actuality is McDonalds that looks fancy. Its just a McDonalds with the same lousy food you can get anywhere else."
98,2,2,Never getting my Mc Ds fix here again! What Mcdonalds doesn't have refills on their drinks? And I've been here many times prior and gotten refills on them. Then randomly one night the manager says they don't offer refills anymore? On top of that my soda was filled to the brim with ice! If that wasn't shady enough their late night menu is filled with all their expensive food items! I'll take my business a few blocks down on Fulton where they have regular items 24/7
104,2,2,"Hubby and I eat from McDonald's a few times per week. I go to 4 in the neighborhood - Chambers St, Fulton St, Broadway and Wall, and this one. I dislike American cheese, and substitute white cheddar in an egg mcmuffin. Every store allows me to get the 2 for $4 deal and substitute white cheddar. The food cost difference is under a penny. Last week, they refused at this store. The manager told me that I would have to pay full price for both sandwiches if I wanted white cheddar. She told another staff member that I was a spoiled customer who should never have been allowed to substitute - in front of me.When I told this story to the Fulton St manager, he agreed that this was petty, disrespectful of a regular customer, and said that his store gets constant complaints about this location. So, I am now going to be vocal about this.I have done the review surveys and heard nothing back from the store manager, even though I requested that someone contact me."
106,2,2,Ordered at 1:08. Waited for my food till 1:23 (it was very busy) I asked them where my food was and they checked and realized they deleted my order. So I got my food at 1:28. Waited 20 minutes for my food. Thats my lunch break right there.
107,1,1,The Double Beef Cheese Burger is probably the best thing in the planet
108,1,3,"Nice place to be at when you are hungry and need quick food . Whether you looking for breakfast or lunch ons , they have got you covered . Worth trying the hash potatoes"
109,2,2,"Ronald, something tells me that your crew here ain't ""lovin' it."" Depressing was the ambiance, where tables were decorated with leftover crumbs and grease, as though to act as a customer repellant. There were travelers freeloading shamelessly off the outlets to charge their phones, folks dining solo after a long day at the office, a pair of bearded hobo pals, and a sleepy-looking guy that looked like a meth addict who had come in to satisfy his munchies with something cheap. The mish-mash of citizens was like an urban, modern-day version of The Breakfast Club.It was a bit unsettling as I sat there, clutching cautiously onto my handbag. (I was in no mood to be getting mugged and catapulting myself upon a perpetrator, as I had been walking all day.) I couldn't help but feel unsafe, and this is coming from someone who's lived in New York all her life. Inside this virtually dead and deserted McDonald's, you wouldn't know that it is located on one of the busiest streets in the Financial District, the blocks filled with people waiting at bus stops, where it is inevitable to bump into clueless tourists and impatient white collar workers alike. I would recommend dining at 160 Broadway instead, if you are determined to get your fix, where the restaurant is better maintained, and has live entertainers on the second floor playing music throughout the day to lift spirits of the weary, hungry, and tired.If you don't mind dining amongst shady low-lives, however, then feel free to boldly come here, but heed my words: guard your personal belongings, or I guarantee that someone will be running off with more than just your Happy Meal."
110,2,2,They are dishonest and charge more than the signage says.  When i complained they simply said iced tea is not a soft drink & so the sign is right.  They are the only McD that has the sign up and doesnt charge $1.I found the service slow & rude and the restaurant dingy and dirty.It is not like most McDsI love McD but will never visit that location again
111,2,2,"Crazy busy, minimal control over the lines/wait, and over 140 seats upstairs (literally there's a sign at the door for that).2 Big Macs for $5 right now (sandwiches only)."
112,2,2,"My ""to go"" experience, I come here to grab breakfast at least once a week. The line to line up is also confusing, people are just standing randomly. One time a person that came into the store later then me got in front of me. She might thought I was waiting for my food and didn't know that I was actually on line.Today I ordered a #9 with hot tea. she repeated ""hot coffee and a #what?"" LOL that was two wrongs in 1 order. i said i ordered a hot tea... shes like ""oh right. what number again?"" she was not ready to take my order so why say next?.... I'm sure my English is understandable and i was not talking low at all. This McDonald is just on the way to work so it's very convenient for me. Therefore, they will see me back here despite my poor review. i just come for my breakfast and go."
113,3,1,Everyday on the way home from work I stop here to use the downstairs restroom for free.  No one every asked me to spend a penny here.  I can't complain.
114,3,3,"The line situation here is a disaster.  There is no room, and there are enough tourists who do not understand the line-up system at NYC McDs. Since it's a busy place, expect to wait in line a bit, get pushed up against a lot of other people, etc.  However, when you do get your food, it will be nice and fresh.  Also, despite the frenzy, this McDonald's accuracy is remarkably good."
115,2,3,"One of the most inefficiently run McDonalds I've ever had the misfortune to visit. Sadly, the location will provide it with constant business, so I'm not betting on better mgmt anytime soon..."
116,2,2,This is one the worst Mcdonald's in the area I rarely come here for breakfast b/c the lines are ridiculously slow the staff is rude and ghetto which considering the area of the city I'm surprised they have employees like this working here.  This place has made me late and I was here for lunch yesterday and the crowds are horrendous they never have enough cashiers morning or lunch rush.  I've complained to coporate before and I got free coupons but they need improvement on service food quality isn't bad.
117,2,1,"Scale of 1-10:Food: 4Service: 0Atmosphere: 1Dinner for 2 people (plus tax): $15Favorite dish: Value meal #7Pros:-It's McDonald's, if you like fast food you'll probably like the food regardless of how incompetent the staff is-Open late or 24 hours, I forget which-They gave us a free order of fries after we waited 25 minutes for a filet o' fish sandwichCons:-Worst service in the city, hands down, and that is saying a lot. Most of the tellers/cooks/preppers etc. are borderline lucid, and the ones that are spend more time talking to each other than serving the customers or cooking the food. At one point I counted 8 people behind the counter, none of whom were taking orders, cooking food, or doing anything that resembled work. Even one of the street bums who came in to get a coffee said it was the worst McDonald's in the city.-Prepare to wait a very long time if there are more than 2 people in line. The tellers don't seem to know how to take orders, enter orders, or fetch the food. The cooks don't seem to know how to cook more than one sandwich at a time when they're not busy goofing around.-That filet o' fish sandwich mentioned above took 3 reminders from me to the tellers who don't seem to have any sense of short term memory, 2 tellers to find the cooks who were goofing off, and 2 different cooks to figure out how to cook the sandwich before it finally came out 25 minutes later. Did I mentioned that there were only 3 customers in the entire restaurant and 8 workers behind the counter doing who knows what while I waited for something to get done.-When I got the fish sandwich everything else was cold-I would rather eat out of the trash can outside the store than dignify this restaurant's workers' existences by going in again. The only reasons I even waited for the fish sandwich instead of demanding my money back were that a) my wife was craving it and b) it would've been a minor miracle if the tellers could figure out something as complicated as how much money to give back to me"
118,3,3,"If you're in the area and feel like McDonalds, this is definitely the place for you.  Pretty standard service, kiosks are no longer usable due to the pandemic situation, but overall, it's what you'd expect from the golden arches."
119,1,1,This is pretty good atmosphere for Nyc arch experience.
120,2,2,"Our family of three was starving and in need of sustenance so we pulled over so I could hop in to grab us a quick bite.No lines was a beautiful sight, and yet the order took a while to compile. I ordered McChicken sandwich with no mayo, small fries, a happy meal, and a meal (can't remember) for my husband. I had enough time to head upstairs to the restrooms, which need some TLC. I hate public restrooms...ugh. There were teenagers seated upstairs, which indicated to me that this was a.an after school hangout spot. I made it downstairs, was handed my huge shopping bag of food, and was out the door. Sadly, my McChicken was nowhere to be found and that's because it was left off the order ticket smh. Clearly there's some room for improvement."
121,1,1,I mean food at McDonald's always 5stars. But the service here been nicer for some reason. So I think I should give them 4 stars. We love it since they open 24hrs and 3 blocks from our place.
122,1,1,"No clue what these other negative reviews are saying. This place is by far the cleanest, most professionally run McDonald's I have ever been to. I ordered the McChicken sandwich. Perfect amount of condiments applied. A+"
123,1,1,Absolutely love McDonald's. I would always come and order a meal of bacon quarter pounder. The entire staff are quick and efficient. Although the ice cream machine breaks too much，the staff tends to you in any way they can. I would definitely recommend coming here and they're busy on weekends.
124,3,1,"This McDonald's is always crowded with people. Because it's always crowded the line is always long. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Their employee is quick and professional. Taking order are really quick thanks to the kiosks machine. Their table ain't away clean, mostly sticky."
125,3,3,"Honestly if you're in the Chinatown area, you probably shouldn't be eating here since there are so many nearby restaurants with good Chinese food. Even so, I stopped in here because I wanted something quick and just to take a break from Chinese food since I have it so often. This McDonald's was pretty huge with multi-floors. It was pretty crowded inside for a Saturday night. I was able to place my order with their mobile app, so I was able to skip the lines for ordering at the counter or with one of the kiosks. I was able to get my food fairly quickly and was on my way. The food (McDouble and a cheeseburger) was pretty standard for a McDonald's. Definitely A-OK."
126,1,1,Best McDonald's location around. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Food is great. The restaurant and bathrooms are clean!
127,1,1,"the best nuggets in NYC! No clue what these other negative reviews are saying. This place is by far the cleanest, most professionally run McDonald's I have ever been to."
129,2,2,Space is small and dirty. The cashiers look SUPER MISERABLE and sounded very annoyed when talking my order. Would not recommend this location at all
130,2,2,See picture. Gave me less than half slice of cheese.  Didnt even put it in the middle.
131,2,2,"I was in here today around 3:45P after failing to find a business that I came specifically down to Chinatown to find.  I ordered the $2.50 double combo which is a double cheeseburger and small fries, The double cheeseburger had 2 slices of cheese , one each over each burger patty,  IT was actually melted.  I couldn't find ketchup either on the first level or the second level.and there was none in my bag. I did find salt and pepper packets and a napkin dispenser,"
132,2,2,Terrible McDonald's that forces customers to buy more food just to stay seated. Even at 2 in the morning.
133,2,2,"At a so called 24 hour establisment,extra small eating area downstairs where order food, the main up stairs eating area was unavailable at 7:55am in the morning.  Never eat at this particular establishment, unprofessional, lack of respect for customer care. The upstairs area could have been cleaned 5:00am thru 6:00am in  preparation of morning guest.  Fire the manager, inability to manage effectively."
134,3,3,"This is probably one of the most expensive McDonald's in America and it doesn't even have a fun theme like, say the Rock N Roll McDonald's in Chicago etc. The food is typical of McDonald's and all of the tourists on canal street come in here to take pictures of the menu and misform lines and use the restrooms.The charging stations do not work but the wifi is free and works pretty well."
135,2,2,"Really bad attitude! Always  missing the food! I have only been there twice. I ordered on the machine but every time they miss the food . When I went back and asked for food from them, the waiter refused to admit the mistake. The attitude was very bad. Really  stupid!"
136,2,3,"McDonald's is fast and easy, sure, but that should not compromise the quality, right? Upon entering I was frustrated because there were no available table numbers at the kiosk. Part of the reason for the kiosk is to be able to order your food and take a number and be seated and wait for your food to arrive. It took me a second to figure it out but this is only because they want to discourage you from dining in. I'll explain further. There are 3 stories to this McDonald's yet the top floor is roped off. This was especially frustrating because there were a lot of guests during my visit and seating was scarce. My visit was in the middle of the day, not nearing closing time. So to have limited access to seating only means one thing: this location discourages you from dining in. It's cold out there folks (review written in winter)! Why can't people sit in McDonald's and enjoy a meal. Again not expecting 5 star service but there should be more accommodation on the restaurant's part. Also, while I and several others were ordering from the kiosks, several workers looked at us, knowing we wouldn't be able to complete our orders without the table holders. That was just plain cruel."
137,2,2,"I don't usually write negative reviews.  And no this is not an april fools joke, I went to this location on 3/31/2014.2 homeless people started an argument and physical fight in the middle of the seating area on the second floor. For 30 minutes! During that time there was, no security. No Staff bothered to go up to check what's going on. Nobody told them to leave Staff came up after they left to pretend they did their jobs to keep the guests safe. 2 homeless people were breaking up and the breakup was very violent The lady started throwing chairs and screaming after the man had left. Staff was nowhere. Nice Job McD."
138,2,2,Always super pack! Not worth the wait if you do come here. They also had my breakfast mc muffin burnt! I don't know what else I can say...
139,2,2,"One of the worst Mcdonald's ever. Music is too loud.Super slow service.3 days in a row the ice cream machine is broken.Nothing on the dollar menu,even one cookie is 65 cents!Need I say more...The one on queens blvd is the worst"
140,2,2,I wasn't raised to be afraid of defending my opinions and thoughts...Always so dame crowed...and so not worth the wait...why you ask...McDonald's is horrible for your health...I mean horrible! Did you know that one breakfast sandwich has all the suggested days worth of calories.... Did you know they cook their fries in fake beef some kinda whatever oil? Did you know their ice cream is fake because if bubbles when it melts? Did you know that their fries won't grow mold...which means that it won't digest in your stomach.... sort of like a Twinkie....Did you know that the use all parts of the chicken including but not limited to the beak and feet...do you really want to eat that??
141,1,1,"I understand that it's just fast food but I eat fast food frequently .  Just lack the budget to indulge in sushi and other fine fare lolI'm also not a sushi person. I love as six mc Donald's for their cheap juicy burger, fast orders and cheap shakes, or if I'm feeling like I want something lighter ony stomach and it's late, a grilled chicken salad, side asald or parfait is great. Excellent for my son, who asks for the yogurt in his kids meal. The mozzarella sticks is also a perfect edition. Their coffee exceeds bk and I loved this location wen visiting last month. Quick easy and clean with upstairs seating. The workers for friendly and helped me when they forgot a drink. Will return"
142,2,2,This place is a zoo.  Mcdonalds needs to step up their game in regards to not allowing loiterers to take over their establishments.  Too many shade characters in here made my dining experience unsettling to say the least.  The same goes for the Mcdonalds on the LES on Delancey street.
143,2,2,As sketchy as only a McDonald's  in Chinatown can be. Drug deals and fake bags all throughout.  Security guard yells at you to HURRY up as you eat.  Welcome to NYC
144,3,1,"Pretty standard for a Mcdonalds.Of course, why would you eat here when Chinatown is a stone's throw away?Upstairs 3rd floor has big colorful chairs and plenty of seating, and there is free wi-fi, and restrooms. It also does get crowded too."
145,2,2,"The place was closed at 3:30 am in the morning. McDonalds should update the timings, because 24/7 is definitely a lie!"
146,2,2,Ugh take the food to go. Fruit fly city!  Matter of fact. Skip this location!
147,2,2,One of the worst McDonald's in the city. Rude staff. Slow service. Big Macs that barely look like Big Macs. Don't go
148,2,2,"Had to give this McDonald's a poor rating just because they gave nor offered any catsup , nugget sauce or napkins and with young kids after climbing to the third floor (very crowded ) had to trek back down with all my kids .....Ronald Mcdonald sucks."
150,1,1,"Best fast food chain, love the new decor* l really like the new decor (bright colors, contemporary soft faux leather cushioned seats* filet o fish, quarter pounder, angus burger, ice cream, wild berry smoothies are best by far among fast food chains * my only gripe is the food has gotten sweeter. Southern chicken and premium chicken are weirdly sweet. Mccafe shakes and frappes are hyper sweet."
151,1,1,Great counter service and quick and friendly people. Hit this spot up if ou looking for a quick bite 24 hrs a day.
152,2,3,Whats with all the junkies in and out all the time?? You people need a security guard! !
153,3,1,"A well maintained 3 story mcdonalds that I usually use as a meeting place when friends are from out of town. We don't actually eat here, but it's a recognizable icon.When I have ordered food here, it is fine and prices are of the norm for Mcdonalds, though cheaper than Times Square.  The furniture here is varied and has bar stools, booths and big wide 1970's style chairs as well."
154,2,2,"We were passing through and needed something really quick. This McDonald's, like most places in Chinatown, was crowded. I went upstairs to use the bathroom and the line was way too long and I did not have time to wait. There are also tables upstairs but all were taken at 2p on a Sunday."
155,1,1,"I used their restrooms here and it was SUPER clean. I was surprised at how clean it was, but the only downfall was that it didn't have toilet seat covers. It is also on the 2nd floor. There were 3 floors to MCd's at this location.It was super packed when I went and they have the chicken bites now!Busy busy mcdonalds."
156,3,3,It has one of the cheapest ice cream in Manhattan.  That's why I gave it 5 stars. I like nothing but the ice cream
157,2,3,"There's just something about eating fast food after a nice buzz that makes my night complete. I had such a hankering for McNuggets that I moseyed on over after my Wine Tasting. These nuggets are no longer in the 5 dollar range, my friend. More like $6.99 for a 20pc. Times have changed and inflation's a bitch. Be prepared to weave around smelly beggars hoarding free plastic utensils and old men asking for free cups of ice as you make your way in or out. Satiating it is. Classy it's not. I think I smelled a whiff of bum ass on my way out. I heart Chinatown. P.S. I asked for 2 Hot Mustard and 2 BBQ sauces. Sweet and sour is for pansies. Total came out to $7.58 after everything"
159,2,2,"I came here one night to order food on a Monday night. I can see that it was busy however it was ridiculous that I waited an hour for my food be ready after placing an order. It seemed that the workers started making the online orders first and not making the kiosk orders. My order along with others sat at the progress section and didn't even start for almost 45 minutes and I only received it because I had to complain that my food was not even started. As a compensation they offered to give me an extra large fries and apple pie. I mean seriously if you could throw in more food in less time why did it have to escalate to this point. Never will I go to this establishment. I could have killed a chicken, plucked it and cooked it faster than my food getting to me. Management needs to start training their employees on how to manage the food ticketing system better. Since they were all over the place. Lots of drinks and ice cream was being served but no food. And every condiments even napkins and straws had to requested to the staff to get to the customer requesting it which delays the meal prep and delivery process."
160,2,2,"Pretty slow service despite not being busy, and kinda dirty. 10 piece nugget order became 8. Strawberry pie was forgotten. Groups of people without masks can walk in."
161,2,2,This mcdonalds has to be the fucking worst of the worst how is that you get my order wrong every single time like lwgit every time i ask for no salt fries i get old stale fries with salt im missing a fucking drink and you burn my nuggets like i dont understand . Then i order a L and M fry and it looks like a medium and small . this mcdonalds looks amazing but there staff and management fucking sucks .
162,1,1,"This establishment has a variety of foods and drinks to chose from, all at an affordable price. This place is very kid friendly! I would recommend going for the 2 for $3 as this a great deal; I would also buy and size soft drink, all $1! Staff is very polite."
164,3,3,This McDonald's is on the bit of the dirtier side and the staff here are kind of rude. I asked for more ketchup but I wasn't able to get any. However the fries are pretty good. The Oreo McFlurry is pretty good too but their McFlurry machine doesn't work half the time.
165,3,3,"The place is always crowded since it's close to a high school. Their service is slow. It's always hard to find somewhere to sit so I normally would do take out. Here and there, there would be a fight between costumers or a fight between a costumer and one of the worker. McDonald's in my opinion have the best fries compare to the other fast food place. I normally would go to McDonald's with my friends to get a small meal when we don't know where to eat or if we don't have that much cash on us."
166,2,2,"This McDonald's deliberately undercooks food. When they're busy they will pull out fried food (nuggets, french fries, etc) before they're done because the workers don't want to wait for the food to be finished. This is unsafe and dangerous. I can't believe McDonald's has such lax safety measures that they continue to let this happen. The health inspector should shut this McDonald's down."
167,3,3,"This newly renovated spot offers a faster checkout with its looking iPads mounted on the wall.Less wait time which avoids the accustomed horrible customer service, which this place was known for."
168,2,2,This location is in my neighborhood and I ordered a 10 piece nugget and only received 8 in the box once I got home and checked. Very bad location.
169,2,3,"If there is a choice for no star, that's what I will be giving. I didn't order any food from this place BECAUSE thank god, I went to use their bathroom first instead of making the order first. First impression, there is quarter machine lock on the door. You have to pay 25 cents to use their ""Bathroom"". Oh, trust me they bath the room very well. The floor is flooded with unknown liquid, I cannot tell it's either regular water or some duty liquid. The most distinguishing bathroom I ever been to. First time ever in my life I see a money lock in the country on a bathroom, this is just hilarious. Based on how the staffs treat the bathroom, you can already image how they treat the food. This place sure will keep me away from McDonald's in general for a very long time, maybe forever. Yikes!!!"
170,3,1,"Corner of Delancey and Essex street, MTA subway right next to the entrance.  Very convenient since it is open 24/7.Downside is there's a lot of people standing out in front.   Whatever their business is, you know it's shady.  Aside from the people who come here, food is McD quality.  Come here when drunk, high, and crazy."
171,2,2,"What a disgrace. The food was ice cold. The nuggets and fries literally had bits of ice on them. Disgusting. On top of everything else, the staff was extremely rude and the facility was a complete dump. Stay away."
172,1,3,"This is the craziest McDonalds I've been to but I typically come here after DJing around 4:30 AM on Saturdays.I've seen fights break out in and outside of it. One time a guy dressed like a day-glo camper was behind me in line and fell asleep on me. One time I was headed in to eat and I saw paramedics pulling a sheet over a dead body. There is no law, order or justice in this particular McDonalds but the food is wonderful.There are coin locks on the bathroom doors but homeless people still use them as temporary homes. The last time I was there a ragtag security force were trying to keep some guy from entering and talking about how ""this is seven weeks in a row, if he comes back the police are gonna taze his ass.""I know that all sounds kinda awful but If I was nearby I would go eat at this McDonalds right now. The food and service is great but it feels like you're dining in a post apocalyptic society. The fries are good, Big Macs good, I've still never eaten a Filet-O-Fish. Someday. I'll probably keep eating at this McDonalds until my inevitable death at this McDonalds."
173,1,1,"This is by far the best McDonald's meal i've had in this city. Although I am blitzed on sour, the burger is uncharacteristically juicy and hot..the fries as fresh as possible. The girl alone behind the counter is handling her duties with grace. This is the gold standard of McDonald's."
174,1,2,I've got this guy Donald to satisfy my carnal cravingsAs ifNo manWouldEver do and mmmmm hit da spot apart like no Mendota ruined like theLast time when your angel sleeps like that it's like that here you can stay you should appreciate 、 ，。一。
175,1,1,"There is something impeccable about the texture of the chicken nuggets here. It's hard, but forgiving. The meat is tender, but any assertion that it lacks personality ignores the adjacency of your sweeet sweet and sour sauce. Yum. The fries were over-salted, suggesting that the chefs were not perfect, but desperate to give me the experience I craved. I bought a coke and a McChicken for good measures. Overall, this is the best McDonalds in the fucking world. Service workers here are kind,but will quickly let you know that you get what you paid for. I'd come back in spite of all its flaws and I'll never forget the first moment of walking in and feeling at home at McDonalds."
176,3,3,"This isn't really a mathematical formula, but the more beer you consume and the more hungry you are, the less skeevy a super skeevy place seems to you.Yes, this is not the McDonald's of your suburban dreams.  It's full of shady characters and they wait until 5 or more people form a line before taking any orders but in the end, you do get your food.Came here after beer club and because I was hungry, I decided it would be a good idea to stop in.  Took awhile to get my food and I was a little freaked out by the clientele.  But I got my cheeseburger and fries and bolted for the subway.Probably would not come here if i was stone cold sober.  But then, I probably wouldn't be hanging out in the Lower East Side if I was sober, you know what I mean?    So if you're hungry, maybe you want to take a chance and come here.  You do the math."
177,1,1,"This McDonald's is pretty standard but I received exceptional customer service from employee ""Amber."" She was helpful, kind and personable which made transformed an ordinary fast food transaction into an excellent experience. Great customer service from workers like Amber is why I value this location and will be back!"
178,2,2,"literally every single time i come here they always forget my nuggets i dont understand how its always the nuggets every time why cant i just get what i paid for no seriously, this has happened to me more than three times now. sometimes i don't have time to rummage through all the crap i bought to see if these employees can actually do their job right, which they clearly can't. where do these nuggets go? why is it only with the nuggets? why"
182,1,1,Boiii this mcjoint rite here is the top quality mcdonalds. Quater pounder wit cheese extra onion extra pickle extra ketchup N large fries always HITS DA SPAAT boiii. Got dam n they burgers really lookin like the picture lmfaoo
183,1,1,"This is my first visit to this McDonald's since it was renovated in 2018, though I've been hitting up this location pretty regularly since 2012.  I'm impressed with the new look, overall cleanliness, and polite staff. I do wish they had a Coca-Cola freestyle dispenser machine. Will be back every week with my McDonald's app. XOXO"
184,2,2,"The slowest MickeyDs in history! Yikes. To be out of jelly, that's strange. Don't come here expecting anything outside or within basic."
185,2,2,"No. No. No. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I've walked by here countless times in the six+ years that I've been going out in the LES. Not once have I stepped inside until yesterday-- when all options were exhausted at 5am. Not even a food cart could be found outside, due to the rain that was coming down. My only option left was this scary McDonalds which had spent previous years taunting me. I thought to myself-- it can't be that bad.But I was wrong. This is the place is where dreams are shattered and lost souls come together. All the workers here are stuck in a strange state of misery. When you step inside and take a look around-- it feels drab, strange, and unsanitary. It also smelt really bad-- which I thought strange but given that it's open 24 hours, I guess some things just are let go over time...I ordered my food, waited about 15 minutes (???) and had numerous strange folks come up to me and try to strike up conversation. Why did I not bring my headphones, I thought? When I finally received my food, I don't think I was ever happier to snatch it out of their hands and run for the door. It's a bit worse than your standard McDonalds-- but in my mind, if you're in the LES, this is the LAST resort when there is nowhere else to get food."
186,2,2,"At 5am, I ordered a bacon, egg, cheese mcgriddle, a hash brown, and a steak, egg, cheese biscuit with no onions. It took 15 minutes to get the mcgriddle and hash brown. I had to have the biscuit remade 3 times. First time was because it was sausage, and second time they made the biscuit with onions. I'm allergic to onions and I stated this after the second time and they just scraped the onions off the biscuit. Still waiting on the biscuit to be made. At least the crowd had attractive women to ease my frustration. At the end they had a new cook and he was learning on the fire. Rush hour, morning breakfast, late night eating; what a way to learn but he will be better for it. -1 for the wait for food -2 for reordering of 1 sandwich 4 times -1 for disregard of my onion allergies"
187,2,2,It amazes me being in the lower east side and this is one of the only places open before 7am for breakfast. Business starts before 7 especially if your traveling to a different area. Anyways typical fast food fair with minimal flavor and people working here are subpar at best but hey it's McDonald's. the reason for the one star is because of cleanliness. This place is a dump. Garbage on the floor tables dirty as hell and bathrooms take quarters and don't even work! Place is gross.
188,2,2,"Stay away! This McDonald's is by far the worst one I've ever been too. While I wouldn't say the place is downright dirty, it definitely doesn't have that bright, shiny clean feel of other McDonald's.  Additionally, they don't participate in many of the normal McDonald's promotions, so you end up paying more than you would at other Mickey Dee's. Lastly, the staff here is just horrible.  When you're ordering, if you look on the left wall (when facing the registers) you'll see their ""6 Steps"" for taking orders, posted on the wall.  The first step is for them to smile, for 10 seconds, I believe. It might as well say ""Roll your eyes and suck your teeth"" for the duration of the order.  Next time, I'm gonna skip this Mickey Dee's and grab me something from the food cart right in front...it's probably more sanitary and healthier any way...."
189,2,2,"So we waited 25 minutes for our order. No apologies. No explanation. Just tons of waiting and rude rude people. It was like if you suddenly had to sit for a 5 course menu, but really it was just waiting for stupid nuggets for an obscene amount of time. Unbelievable. And also my friend got yelled at for sitting down."
190,2,2,This is the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to ever.  And that says a lot considering i am from nyc and have never ever even thought of writing a review on a fast food place.  Terrible service.  Abysmal bedside manner.  It took 20 min just to get an order in with no line while they sprayed cleaning products all over and then cursed me out for wondering where my food was...i could see my cheeseburgers taking a nap in front of me while they got cold.  Never ever go here!!!  How do i put 0 stars?
192,2,2,"this is the worst mcdonald's i have ever went to. my family and i were discussing our order AWAY from the line, yet the cashier kept telling us to come with our order, even when we told the cashier to give us a minute. we ordered food for the rest of our family, and we clearly heard them complain about our orders. we also ordered sweet teas as well, heard them talk about how they didn't have sweet tea but when we had gotten our drinks, it was completely watered down. they had also given us dirty looks when they were making their food or when they gave it to us. considering the fact that their income is going to be $15 an hour, the workers should have at least some respect and manners. i would have given them zero stars if i could."
193,2,2,ghettoooooooooooooooo the staffs here rude and horrible service the place super dirty and smelll horrible horrible ok i get it. it is mcdonald dont expect too much
194,2,2,"The security guard was a racist. Once we got our food and sat down, out of 10 other tables....they decided to tell us we had 10 mins to eat our food and leave because them manager said so. We asked him to point out the manager to show us and he did but she ducked from us all night. We asked if she could come talk to us and apparently she couldn't because she was too busy at McDonald's at 3am. K thanks for being a racist bitch. avoid this place there's a pizza place across the street. Go there."
195,2,2,"For Drunks, Tourists and others coming to empty their bladder in the most legal way possible:Crackheads galore and you can't use the public restroom until you purchase something. They give you a fake old school arcade coin to use the bathroom and insert in the lock which opens the door. You could use a quarter without buying something but make sure not to get stopped by the underpaid makeshift security guard/disgruntled employee working into the wee night hours...If you are coming here for food:Better options are a Halal cart or Nearby Deli"
196,2,2,"This place is ghetto. At times there are hobos loitering there when I want a seat but there aren't any. The manager kicked me and my friends out once because she thought we didn't buy anything when we did. We stayed a bit extra to play Pokemon but it was just 5 extra minutes. There was a cockroach crawling on the wall when I was trying to enjoy my Big Mac and a large cok. I bought grass here one time. (Literally grass, not weed)."
197,2,2,"Nasty place, full of nasty attitudes. If you like drama in the work place the employees here will give your fill."
198,2,2,"Not the best McDonalds location to go to, now I know.  Next time I am around this delancey area I will not go here.  I got Hot Fudge Sundae and something was wrong with the ice cream, it didn't taste right- Maybe it was their machine.  They just poured it out and it was mush already.  I got the train before I realized my fries were not hot either and not a Monopoly game piece on it.  Another strike against them for that one, should be a few more days.  I agree with some other people reviews, the workers are definitely not the friendliest ever.  I should have gone to Popeyes right next to this."
105,2,2,"So many bad things to say about this location where do I begin. For starters they have 2 floors and Everytime Im here only the bottom floor is open. Secondly the staff at this location is HORRIBLE! Very rude, not very welcoming, everyone is having their own side conversation infront of the customers. Not to mention someone who is dressed that looks like a manager is one of them carrying a side conversation infront of everyone! The only one I see actually doing their job very hard is the person cleaning the eating area. I can see someone sitting at a table in the back on their phone. Not really sure why. This McDonald's needs a proper staff who knows about hospitality. On top of everything someone who ordered after me left before me with their food waited about 15 minutes for a hamburger it's ridiculous.Update : just heard someone say the bacon is rotten super loud infront of customers. SMH!"
200,1,1,High Holy Days at The Actors' Temple.  We have recently completed a series of Jewish Holidays at the Actors Temple on West 47th Street in Hell's Kitchen--but it was Heaven at our seats in the Actors' Temple--I believe we had 19 services in something like 25 days!!  These services were conducted by the indefatigable Rabbi Jill Hausman with Cantorial Assistant Aron Bederson.  Their beautiful voices reached heaven and touched us at all levels.  Marina Kifferstein gave us her violin performance  at Kol Nidre.  It was quite an experience not to be forgotten.  Rabbi Hausman gives 110% with each service.  I am sure those attending for the first time will come back as members.  There are Shabbat Services on Friday nights at 7pm and Saturday morning services at 10:30 both with Onegs following the service.
202,2,3,Ghetto ass McDo catered to the drunkards (like myself) after a night of debaucher in the LES.
203,2,2,"***Not that anyone will ever read this, because drunk people don't listen to reviews: this is the most disrespectful, conniving, rude establishment and you should rather stab your eyes out with straws before giving them any money.  they PURPOSEFULLY did not give me TWO items i ordered, attempting to seal up the bag before i could notice.  When i did, the girl acted like she forgot it, gave me my order of large fries, then laughed at me.  When i saw i was also missing a ""snack wrap,"" she handed me one left on the grill.  At this point, i politely asked this cahier/runner's name (she was missing a name tag), and she refused to give it to me.  I asked for her manager, and a woman on the grill line with a un-labelled lanyard indicated her authority.  The two exchanged demeaning glances, muffeld speech, from which i only heard, ""i got you girl,"" from the ""manager..."" and i was disgraced, so i left without even getting the proper sauce for my nuggets (oh, yes, first world problems.)Also they didn't give proper change to my friend, who paid for one sandwich with a $20 and was shorted $5.  When he called, once we got home, the woman on the phone identified herself as Darlene.  Nice move now, whether it's fake or not.  My next call is to corporate!it is disgusting.  other customers were appalled but too drunk to care.  i used to work at a McDonalds landmark location WHEN I WAS 14 (OH DID THEY CHECK TO MAKE SURE I WAS OF AGE TO WORK THERE? NO.).  All it ought to take now, is a few more competent people to report their same findings, then this location gets a whole new staff.  OH, right- no one wants to work there.  Especially this hour.  Makes me fear for all mankind more than yuppies are afraid of the clown Ronald McDonald.""I hope those bitches enjoy their train back to Harlem."""
204,2,2,"one word ""cockroaches"". the food tastes like the floor outside... note to self: worst McDonalds ever..."
205,2,2,"I had an employee throw a shoe at me at this location at 430am thursday morning. She was yelling at 2 drunk individuals who had a shoe sitting on their table and she threw it and it hit me squarely in the leg.  When I complained that she had struck me with said shoe, she told me to ""shut the f*ck up bitch"""
206,1,3,I guess being harassed and almost puked on by a hobo might merit a one star review...by others- but this is the most amazing mcdonalds of all time.  i half expected harmony korine to pop out of the trash can with his video camera.
209,2,3,If I could give it a half star I would have. The people at this McDonald's are friendly and seem quite capable. Yet for some reason I NEVER have gotten my order right. Something is always amiss. They are clean and courteous so I keep trying.  I am not giving up on the place because let's be honest sometimes you need that fox but damn it try and be more conscious of what you are putting in our bags.
208,3,2,"Pregnancy is weird. (Or so I've gleaned from observation. I have yet to get pregnant myself, I've just been very close to someone who has.)One day all food makes you nauseous to the point of vomiting, and the next you absolutely NEED a sausage biscuit with egg. From McDonald's. Even though you haven't eaten McDonald's in years. Well, I'm glad this McDonald's is here, because if my wife who hasn't eaten real food in a month wants McDonald's, she's going to get it. And she got it. And she liked it. I personally regret getting a burger for myself because it was barely edible, but to her credit, the sausage biscuit with egg is pretty solid (I got one on another occasion; had I tried to take a bite of hers, I would've lost a hand)."
210,1,1,"I don't know what the last person was talking about - it's delicious. Nice people too. Fries were hot and fresh!!!  One of the better McDonald's I've been to. Reminds me of the French McDonald's which, if you've never been, they are tres chic."
212,2,2,"Not going to sugar coat it, this McDonald's is the worst I've ever been to on a few different levels. Customer service is non existent. You are inconveniencing the staff by ordering there. Food is never fresh. Good luck trying to fix your order when something undoubtedly is wrong. Just avoid it, even if your inebriated self thinks it's a great idea. It's not."
103,3,3,"Just like any McDonald place it's a very busy, noisy, and dirty store. Service isn't good, little space to eat, people are slow, there's lots of things wrong with McDonald's. However like any McDonald place, it's McDonald's and the burgers are great, the fries are great, and it's a favorite to all the kids. Not only that but the food is cheap, there are lots of things to choose from to eat and plus, if you don't want to eat there take it home. The food will fill you up for a cheap price and will taste good too. Even if the place needs improving, McDonald's is McDonald's and it makes for a good dinner."
102,2,2,"So gross. This place really needs to improve in many ways. Yes, I'm aware it's a McDonald's but no excuse. Can the cashiers be less miserable?Can you chase away the dregs of society from harassing customers outside?Can you clean this place up?I like this McDonald's, however, for their iced coffee and $1 fee ATM."
215,2,2,Unbelievably slow and disorganized. Easily one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been too. I've had food brought out faster at a sit down restaurant than it comes out here. Very often dirty. Staff doesn't seem to know what they're doing.
216,2,2,"Not fast at all. My kids always want to come here and I have given in. The tables are filthy. The toys in the happy meal are never what's advertised (and the employees have forgotten to put toys into the happy meals on several occasions).The touchscreen ordering stations are not an element of convenience. It's over complicated and not efficient. When your order is called, it's usually not complete and it's on the customer remind the employees that the drinks are missing.What a miserable experience. Five Guys is much better all around. In the words of my 8-year-old son, ""I don't like this McDonald's."""
217,1,1,I really like the new design of this store. The big screens make ordering very easy and who would have thought that you can get table service at a McDonald's! WOW
199,1,1,"For a McD this is good.  Fast, clean, and a good stop after a drunk night on Delancey.Bring your quarters, folks - you have to pay for the bathroom!"
213,2,2,I'm never going back  to this McDonald's long story short I had one bite left I found a hair in my food they nasty af  I would put no stars but can't
220,3,3,Since they remodeled this Micky D's the service is better. The service use to suck. The customer service use to be garbage. But there's a difference now.
221,2,2,"This Mickey D's is great for some late night grub if you're coming in after a night of partying... but the food is just wayyyy inconsistent. For example, once I picked up a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit, and the biscuit was super dry. Disappointing indeed! So, the next time I go in, I order a sausage, egg, & cheese McMuffin b/c I'm thinking the biscuit will be dry again so I'll try the muffin instead. Well, they accidentally give me the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit-- and instead of returning it to the counter, I eat it anyway... and, what do you know, the biscuit was succulent and flaky!!! I thought these fast food restaurants had some type of quality control so that the food tastes the same every time. Apparently not!!! I mean, the BE&C biscuit from Mickey D's is one of my favorite brekky treats as a kid. To come across a dry-ass biscuit is just blasphemy. Another example: on my last visit, they featured a special of two Filet-o-Fish sandwiches for $4. Well, I didn't need two sandwiches, so I ordered one for $2. I was super excited b/c I hadn't had a Filet-o-Fish in years, but ughhhh, the bread was super dry... and the fish patty was super small, overcooked, and hard as a rock. Nasty! Note that this location of McDonald's is really ugly inside. It is in desperate need of remodeling! Trust me, only go here if you are desperate for some late-night grease."
219,2,2,"This is a terrible McDonald's, definitely one of the worst I've ever been in.  If you can get past the homeless people and school kids hanging out in front of the door, you'll find out that they NEVER have ice cream or shakes.  It's too bad you won't find that out until after you've paid, and then they'll offer you a smoothie or some other not-at-all-what-I-ordered substitute.The good news is that the people behind the counter will provide you with a free in-person soap opera to watch while you wait for your food or refund.  They're always busy flirting and trying to hook up with each other, or if you're lucky, one of the customers.Oh, and I hope you like hearing the N-word.  A LOT."
223,2,2,"Employee put her dirty finger inside my cup and tried to give me the cup with coffee. When I refused it and requested a new one, she laughed. Brought to the manager's attention and wasn't phased by it"
224,2,2,"Not sure if Yelp reviews for McDonald's do anything. But this McDonald's is absolutely terrible. The staff is so incompetent, lazy, and ghetto. They don't give a f$&# about their jobs or anyone. It also took me 10min to get a quarter pounder. They basically ran out of stuff. I kept hearing the ""supervisor""  saying ""Where's this?  Do we have this?"" . Hire actual competent staff. Not just any rat from the streets"
225,3,3,"Yay I'm a fan. I stopped going to the Fulton McDonalds in favor of going to this McDonalds because the staff in Court McDonalds is so much better than Fulton McDonalds staff. The food is the same quality. But the price is significantly cheaper. I calculated and saw that I can save $1.87 on the same orders in this McDonalds than the Fulton McDonalds. The staff here aren't as racist as the Fulton McDonalds. Also there are more available seating here and the Kiosk here. The bathrooms are bad here, but at least its 100x better than the Fulton McDonalds."
226,3,3,"i worked in brooklyn for a bunch of years , downtown brooklyn to be exact , on court st and ronald mcdonald's house was my morning hangout to grab some breakfast before i made my trek to work a few blocks away . now fast foward a bunch of more years and i am back on court st to say hello to some old friends and it's early morning  and i got some more time to waste . it's totally different now with less seating and more space and the stairs leading to the upper level is almost the same but with new tiles . the typical mcd menu with heavy displays of the dollar menu all around . as i recall back in the day to the present , you still have your lost souls sitting and letting the day go by maybe ordering a small coffee or fries ,some things never changed . the lines move fast and wait for order is minimal . this court street mcdonald's has been around a long time and brings back some memories of my time working in brooklyn.  p.s. in all the years i worked in the  area i never had lunch at this mcdonald's ,  go figure ."
227,1,1,The tap water here is A1. Never have I had tap water that tasted this good. THE HIGHEST QUALITY. Better than Poland Spring and even better than Aquafina. New York City should have this tap water everywhere. 10/10 would recommend. The McNuggets were alright too.
228,1,1,"McD's is McD's...place is open 24 hours in bk heights and a lot of teenagers hang out here on the weekends late night.  only place really open in that area to get something to eat at 4am. its so good, but the food just sits in your stomach all night long - ewww"
229,2,2,"I have been to this mcdonalds a few times simple because I work in the area and I only get a 30 min lunch break... which means my options are on a time crunch as it is...However my experience at this particual location is pretty much the worst... The majority of the staff is rude, and as the previous person said before, the staff rather be on there phone, then to do there job and take care of the customers....The place is filthy, and the majority of the staff that works there are either hispanic or african american, I have yet to see any caucasions work there, and the staff does treeat the causcasion customers really bad... There is only one girl that works there that I actually like, who actually is nice to everyone... I wish I knew her name, beucase she is the only I like becuase she actually works and treats ever single customer with respect and a smile I wish the staff there could learn something from her... but everyone else is just rude and ghetto-fab..(is that the right term)All i know is when you are at work, you should treat everyone with the same respect regardless of what they are... and furthermore Ive seen there manager... and management isnt any better...To be honest with you, with todays job market the way it is, im sure there are plenty of hard working people that would trade places with this staff, and work with pride, respect and work as a team.. So if your looking for a decent place to eat on a time crunch, go across the street, and check out Checkers, atleast the staff there Treats people with respect... and you wont recieve the aweful experience that me and many others have recieved from this place..."
231,3,3,"This is definitely one of the craziest McDonald's in Brooklyn, but the food is consistently fresh. It's always busy, full of kids, parents, confused tourists, hungry ppl on break, and then there are the indigent. Some scammers, some homeless, primarily congregating downstairs outside the restroom area.  Know that your visit there will have loud interactions amongst staff, odd odors and possible panhandlers, but you will also have fresh food, messily put together."
232,2,2,The worst McDonalds ever. No bathroom. Took 10 minutes for a cheeseburger. Everyone in the kitchen is singing explicit rap music. Which wouldn't bother me if they were actually doing their jobs. Avoid at all costs.And see the attached picture. I ordered one thing- cheeseburger only ketchup. They couldn't even get that right.
233,2,2,"Your menu (and every other McDonalds I've been to) state you carry sugar free vanilla syrup.Here you get a snotty ""We don't have that here"". Take it off the menu board then?Tables are filthy at 6am. Can't spare a person to wipe em down?"
234,2,2,"This McDonald's workers are very rude , they have conversation amongst each other loud if they're in the park hanging out . No customer service at all and rude ."
235,2,2,"Just tried to get food at 12:22 AM, they close at one, but have no food available because they're closing soon ..... get it together McDonald's."
236,2,2,"This is probably the most ratchet McDonalds I've ever been to. The cashier was beyond ghetto and unprofessional. Her nails was very long and ugly. And as I'm watching her from my seat, she digging in her ear. Nasty B****. When placing my order, she starts talking to another associate laughing and giggling, then looks back at me with an attitude. The manager should be ashamed for letting this behavior happen."
237,2,2,"The cashier thinks she's Cardi B. More like Cardi C for crackhead. No breakfast at all at any time they just say ""nah, none of that."" No dipping sauces. You may get your burger an hour after you order it. Walk a block to the other Mc Ds that's at least below average and gets you your meal."
238,2,2,This is probably the worst one ive ever been to. literally the slowest. if u have 30 mins to waste then this is your spot.
239,2,2,I ordered a large iced coffee from the kiosk at 11am no food just coffee. Finally at 1120am I asked someone who worked there who was very nice where it was. She asked the beverage person where it was twice and both times she said oh it's on it's way. Then finally at 1132am I had an iced coffee thrown across the counter at me and all that was said was hazelnut and it went sailing across the counter and she disappeared needless to say I will not be back!
240,2,2,I wish I could give Zero stars for these morons. They're in Uber eats to deliver to our hotel at late night but have cancelled on us twice. Why lead us on for 20 minutes just to cancel our order?! It's just plain foul.
241,2,2,I rather starve then come to this slow piece of shit ass McDonalds! These mutherfuckers waited until I got to the front of the line to say they were closing the line. Now I'm standing on the back of another long ass line. Mutherfuckers is clueless! And skipping ppl! Fuck this location! And the dumb ass manager who stood there while ppl complained! Ohhhh now this happens... So I'm finally at the register and the asshole ask the man behind me can i take your order. I yell hellloooo you don't see me standing here? *rolls eyes* I'm still gonna get my fries tho lol
242,2,2,"Waited 42 minutes for a large coffee. It would have been quicker to walk to target, buy a coffee maker, make the coffee, return the coffee maker for a refund, and then get a sandwich at a diner with the money. Skip this McDonald's."
243,2,2,"This McDonald's is awful.  The person who took my money tonight is a thief, and stole my money.  My hope is that they clean house, remove thiefs, and make right.  I had to make an example of my order tonight, because this location failed.  Sorry."
245,3,3,"Food is delicious, But workers are not nice to customers, they talk to you the way like you are eating for free! McDonalds has to take pretty and nice talking people for work!"
246,2,2,When your cashier calls next while looking at you and you're walking up to him. It's his job to tell the rude lady that jumps the lime out of nowhere and starts order to wait her turn. I can't with you hoodrats. But I cannot even more when you're working like you get commission for every burger.
247,2,2,Probably the worst McDonald's I've ever been to.. Employees don't look happy and giving attitude the food is inedible wasn't really happy on myLunch break u expect to eat well to go back to work but now I'm just disappointed and lost appetite .. Never coming back to this McDonald's for sure..  Fries taste like if they was sitting for literally 24 hours . Thumbs down.!!!
248,2,2,"It is unfortunate any review at least generates a star automaticly while this sort of site never deserves even one. In a way, this provides good data to see how people's minds are wrecked by poverty and un(-der?)education. Yeah, all I mean is 'can't get any lower. This is not for people. Animals. Mc Zoo.'It is entirely my fault to set my foot on the site. But once in a while I need a field trip at my own risk. They never fail to live up to your expectation if you need data for sociology or anthropology.So I had to balance if it would be really worth when I was not sure if it took about 15-20 mins to get one snack wrap to go. The result--the wrap came out too cold when I felt it in the bag that the animalstress pushed back in the most hostile manner in any service industries despite that I had already asked to heat it adequately. I had to ask another Madame Animal to heat it up again. You can't blame me if it is really backed up that nothing really communicates to them unless someone raises one's voice or brings it into a brawl. I don't believe any of those ghetto etiquettes, though. So I respectfully but firmly returned the wrap to have it heated more sufficiently. After a heated discussion on the cold wrap from my side, the McZoonald and another customer who was participating in it, the hearing was accepted and the wrap was taken back to be heated, to come back completely soggy afterwards. I was sad not because the wrap was not up to par--I knew this would not be and it was never a big deal for this was a social experiment that i needed--but because these people are too much of retarded.The BIG McDonald's corporate runs because it rip off these stupid employees for lowest wages and sell these junk to also people who don't know any better than this. Such a good field trip I had I don't need another for a couple of years."
249,2,2,"Ugh.... If you really need to, go for it.  No joy to be had here however, brace yourself for sawdust fries and dried out pickles - this place is best summed up by a ringing endorsment known as ""meh..."""
251,1,1,Good place to come for refreshments. The decor is beautiful. This is one of the few McDs that offer $1 for any size soft drinks : )
252,2,2,"A computer user error caused my lunch plans to change.All of the self-service ordering kiosks were in use so I waited in line behind one other person to order at the register (old school)After the first person was sent to cashier 1, I patiently waited for cashier 2 (only 2 available)I start to give my very complicated order (a #1 with unsweetened ice tea) when someone appears from the side and starts complaining to the same cashier about his computer usage issue.My order at this point was forgotten about and I was left in no-man's land.Walked out....well done McDees"
254,2,2,"You know. . . . there's something weird about this McDonalds. Though, most of them are kind of foul and disgusting. In my inebriated state for the first time ever I tried one of those digital pads that you clicky clicky and pick what you want to eat without any human interaction. The advertising outside was what sold us. $3 meals. . . . . well I could just get a dinner roll on my way home but screw it let's cause tarnation to our stomach linings! So I ordered some kind of chicken sandwich and a small fries. And boop it was ready immediately. I asked for a bunch of sauce after I paid. (That's the trick kids, so you aren't charged for it). Hold on. McDonald's sells a creamy vodka tomato sauce that they label as their 'signature sauce' now?! Honey, I'm home. Can I take 15 packets of this to go? No, seriously. Can I? I didn't. . . . . Overall, I hated my sandwich. It was horrible. I feel like crap today partially because of these poor life decisions. The fries were solid and as memorable as I remember them being. I also indulged myself with ordering an apple pie since I don't think I've ever had one and it sucked. But I was mostly upset that their soft serve machine was broken - so NO MCFLURRYS for me. Why the 2 stars you ask? There are house flies everywhere. I mean everywhere. The fact that I both can't see shit and even moreso when I'm drinking and noticed like half a dozen within the 15 minutes I was here remarking on our value meals really says something. Maybe get some spray going on or a fly swatter. It can totally change the atmosphere of a place. Just saying.*Edit: So after much investigating, because I really need to get down to the bare facts on everything. McDonald's came out with their signature sauce around 2003-2004 to accompany their buttermilk chicken tenders. And this is how hip and with it I am on the fast food service industry."
255,2,2,"I love McDonalds breakfast but of the 6 times I've been here recently, this is the 2nd time they forget my hash brown and today I found a hair on my egg. I used to frequent this McDonalds in the past and it seems like the service has declined.  I haven't had any issues with the workers but there is one young worker that is occasionally at the service counter and is very unprofessional and rude with the patrons. I'm sad to say that It looks like I might have to find another breakfast spot for my treat days."
256,2,2,Cannot follow simple instructions. Asked for no cheese on item twice. Only to have cheese in the items.Aside from that I recieved a drink that was sour and way passed due. Asked for an exchange and gave an attitude. if I get sick from drinking a sip of the spoiled drink be counting that I am reporting this to DOH.Never again am I visiting this location.
257,2,2,"The AC has been broken at this location for years. So every summer they install these useless portable units and leave the doors open, making them even more useless. As a result this place is infested with flies. Regardless of how hungry you are or how many coupons you have, DON'T DO IT!"
258,1,1,"A good sized high tech McDonald's. I'm not one to come to McDonald's often for pretty much anything but it was a very hot day out and wanted a milkshake, a not pricey one at that. Ordered a black and white milkshake. Waited for about 3 minutes which I guess isn't bad, hey as long as the machine was working I guess. Other than that not much else to say about this McDonald's location.Oh, there is a lot of seating, so it's good for groups a league sporting team just finishing a game and they have some good bakery options like croissants and pastries. So, definitely a recommend if you just want a quick bite but necessarily a sandwich or something fried."
259,2,3,"I like how they have advanced technology so they can take our orders faster. However, that isn't very useful if we're going to have to wait 10-15 minutes for a small drink or a cone of icecream. The soda machines have a lot of choices although the sprite can taste a little funky sometimes. Also, the icecream machine here never works. All in all, I only come here when I'm desperate to get a drink."
260,2,2,"Paid a quick visit to this McDonalds on my way back from Target. Since it's Christmas Eve I let a couple of things slide like the cleanliness of the place. There were napkins and receipts all over the ground. In addition there was water on the floor which is a safety hazard along with other liquids leaking from the soda fountains. What is absolutely unacceptable is there was a male worker at the register, he went to the kitchen area and Camden back to the register with a mop in hands. A customer came and this male employee then proceeded to take this customers order while holding the mop in the other hand. He wasn't wearing any gloves, he made no attempt to go wash his hands and then continued to take food orders and pass them out to other customers waiting for their food. Would the CEO of McDonalds approve this kind of customer experience? What's about the manager? Disgusting as it is if customers gets sick from the food because of contamination what does that say for the McDonald Brand? I have photos and am upset that I even spend $25 dollars here, I didn't even bother asking for a refund seeing as it took 30 mins for us to receive our order which I threw out. Thanks."
261,2,2,"Working in the field and all around the city, wherever I am at the time my lunch break I stop to eat.  My coworkers do the same. I really don't eat at McDonald's much I said I had a client right next door I decided to come inside.  Firstly there is no air conditioning so it is hot and muggy in here. Secondly, after placing an order and paying at kiosk, I used the restroom and came back to wait for my order.  It was a little busy and the employees seem to be a bit disorganized. Seems they need more training as far as working in a fast-paced environment [ also, the numbers on the screen didn't match the ones they were calling-which is pointless if you're not paying attention]. Then I came to sit down by the door so I can catch a breeze [to no avail] and also charge my phone. When I came to sit down, there were several open seats, however, the counter was still wet after being wiped down [I assume] and then i was a bit grossed out bc the broom and mop were leaning on the stool and wall right next to me and I had to wipe off ANY seat I was going to sit on. I appreciate them cleaning but I sat here for 20+ mins and it was still left next to me amd I watched the employee refilling ice and walk back and forth past the broom/mop. What makes matters even WORSE is that there was only hand santizer in the bathroom amd no running water! (Luckily I didn't get a meal and just fries and an oatmeal). This is SUPER unsanitary [Hand santizer when handling food is nowhere near enough]. To add insult to injury, my fries were luke warm and dry as hell. Please do better! (Will not eat from here again)."
262,2,2,On 2/20/20 @ 6:10 I observed the young lady at the fries stand opening the fries sleeve with her bare hands and then knocking the extra fries back into the tray with her bare hands. DISGUSTING!!!
263,2,2,Disgusting and very disturbing treatment of their chickens. Please don't go here! Imnotlovinit.com is the website I found that showed me the truth behind McDonalds' chickens.
264,3,3,Large fries Mcdonald are a lot more than what I remember the price to be. :( they also gave me a medium in a large box. But at least the staffs are nice!
265,2,2,Disgusting place. Homeless people sleep here overnight which is very concerning especially when considering hygiene of the place and kitchen. This branch should be shut down. Would never come here and eat.
266,2,2,"If you want to eat here, expect slow service and frequent mistakes with your orders. I know I shouldn't expect much from fast food, but neither should you. Only eat here as a last resort."
267,2,2,"This place looks pretty, as it has been remodeled.  Don't let a pretty face fool you.I waited over ten minutes for two McMuffins while the crew in the kitchen chatted loudly with each other.The tables were filthy.Coffee was lukewarm.And, the Self-Order kiosk didn't work right.I live in the neighborhood, and this is pretty typical of this location.  Anyway, and here is the craziest thing:  My receipt said the restaurant manager is Jesus.  Now, he's got a lot on his plate.  But, we're not asking for endless fishes, all-you-can-drink water-into-wine, or even healing some of the crazy homeless people walking around muttering to themselves - just hot coffee, a clean table, and the ""fast"" part of ""fast food."" What does it take, a miracle?Anyway with this review, like peace-out I'll go elsewhere from now on."
268,1,1,"So I was coming out of the gym again after a late night workout and hunting down any place that was still open for business after 11 PM. This part of Lower Manhattan all the way down by Battery Park shuts down early, after normal work hours the place is like a ghost town. The bright lights of the Golden Arches shone like a beacon in the night sky.I did my usual breakfast for dinner routine and ordered 2 Sausage Egg & Cheese McMuffins. Simple, fast, and they hit the spot."
269,2,2,"The service here gets worst & worst. Last week I ordered 4 piece nuggets and waited 20 mins. It wasn't even busy. There were two customers including me. It was late, and the employees were busy talking and recording snapchat videos on the line. I came here before class today to get a coffee, 30 mins before class. I had an exam today. Waited 45 minuets. I had to ask for it three times before i finally got it. I understand it's busy but the employees take their sweet time for everything. The staff here are all rude. And i've been coming here often for the past three years. But after today, I'm never returning to this location."
270,3,3,"While this mcd is cleaner then others, it seems to be ""better"" then other mcds in the area. But the constant losing orders via kioses. Then when you finally get your order 10-30 mins later.... you find they been modifying the fries to accept less fries.... I mean this hasn't been new... they been doing it for at least 3 years."
271,2,2,"Possibly the worst McDonald's anywhere. The staff blatantly do not care. The service is so slow. The food is always cold. I'm done with this place after last night waiting nearly 15 minutes for an order of fries (a crazy pregnancy craving, it's all I can eat and keep down!) my order was left out before being called and was stone cold by the time I eventually got it. I will haul myself (baby bump and all) to which McDonald's is closest after this one just to avoid the TriBeCa location in the future."
272,2,2,Another crazy experience during lunch here. The manager needs to train the staff way better. Customer service is non-existent. From the cashier yelling at the customers to move to one side to the lady screaming out pick up order numbers. Not only is she loud and obnoxious; she's very rude fussing at customers for taking a seat when they have to pick up their order. I never experienced a McDonald's like this..quite disturbing.
273,2,2,This is the flagship McDonalds... why are they so stingy with the fries?! And why is it so hot in there?! This Mickey D's is supposed to be the pinnacle of McDonalds and they always short change you on the french fries and the Air Conditioning seems totally nonexistent. I dont know how the workers deal with it.
274,2,2,"SS tried to buy some McDonald's breakfast but they took mad long. He came there at 10:00AM SHARP and served him close to 11:00AM. Such a disappointment. Although, they did try to make it right by offering an extra free food item but he denied it. He left McDonald's in a limo. He's not coming here ever again and he suggests to do the same. It's about time we run them out of business. Jesus the manager please change your ways."
275,1,1,This place is always drowsy but the positive side is that you can order through the machine. So you don't need to stand in the big line. You will get fast service here. Staffs are friendly. Food is fresh. Air condition is so good. Always perfect environment. Enough tables. You can have a meal and enjoy the view in same time. I recommend this place.
276,2,2,No ac and the customer service was garbage. The cashier was too busy talking to someone on FaceTime to do her job.
277,2,2,"This is the worst place ever!! They seriously need to get their sh*t together here or they might as well shut down. I went there 2 days ago with my family. We ordered the new tomato melted mozzarella burger. When we got it there was no mozzarella in it, it was cold as ice and we thought oh well it's a easy fix. When we got it back the lady who made it just threw a cold piece of mozzarella on it that was not melted at all. Then we went back again and the kid behind the register told us that they never melt the cheese on the burgers but if we wanted to he could microwave it for us. Microwave it???? Are you serious?Then when we were waiting on the rest of our order the kid at the register literally were on his phone texting and not paying attention to any of the customers at all. He didn't even say hi or anything. And when my cousin had ordered he just handed him the receipt looking down at his phone not even looking at him.This place need a serious check up and a new staff would be great!"
278,2,2,"If you can't bring the food to the table when we order from the kiosk, then don't offer the service. I ordered a sundae and after a while I went to the counter and the sundae was melting. Awful..."
280,2,2,"This McDonald's is horrible. Terrible customer service, unable to get the orders done on time. Can not multitask. Do not take there job seriously. Unfit to make the orders correct for many customers."
281,2,2,Slow bad service. Spent 20 minutes waiting for 2 Big Macs. Would give 0 stars if I could.
282,2,3,"I have some complaints about this particular establishment. First of all, there are not enough seats considering the fact that it is near about four schools. Whenever I come to visit especially after the dismissal time (around 3-4) there are massive numbers of students just hanging around, standing up while eating their food. The service is ok, sometimes the cashiers can be extremely rude, but I do understand the amount of stress they are under. The food is alright considering its price point, not that different from other McDonald's I have visited in the past. The entire environment is extremely unsanitary, with dirty floors and tables. Do not even get me started on the restrooms, I would rather urinate my pants than use their facilities. Overall, I give this establishment a 2/10. There are some aspects you guys can definitely improve on and I hope my comment and others can help create a guideline in making this a better environment for your customers."
283,2,2,"Never in the last 50 years have I waited for 45 min for a kids meal at any McDonald's in the world.  And people who work here seemed to have got used to this as so many customers were complaining and the workers had no emotion at all.  Manager and employees had absolutely no sense of urgency to serve.  They are lucky to be still in business because of the location.  I can't say enough bad things about this.  Negative star, avoid at all cost."
284,2,2,Not sure how this place is during the day but at night it sucks. I work at night and on rare occasions come here to get a snack.  It is the worst. The food taste like its been left out for some time.  They are always playing loud spanish music and being obnoxious as they are filling your order. On top of that it is usually filled with homeless people sleeping or begging for change. Stay away.
218,2,2,"The absolute worst........ no organization. No manners. No nothing. Gave my food to the wrong person then had the nerve after the guy brought it back. Tried to give it to me. Asked for new food. I honestly don't know what was the difference, they rush the food. Fries was horrible. Food was horrible. Not me again.... if this is what McDonald's is coming to. I'll pass and go to the next restaurant this is why expensive restaurants thrive because they'll pay for good service rather than this disgusting treatment McDonald's are serving its customers"
286,2,2,This McDonald's is never cleaned. The staff here doesn't not care about the dining area. They only come out from the back end to to serve food to the customers. Tables are never cleaned thoroughly. It's homeless people living in the back by the bathroom. The soda machines stay sticky. Never in proper uniforms. One person wearing a white t shirt the other not even in uniform. All of these people need to be retrained. And I thought the managers had to go to what they call McDonalds University for training purposes. Yea ok. I would rate them a 1.0% out of 100%. By the way. I e never seen a General Manager in this McDonald's.
287,2,2,"I never thought I'd be writing a review for a McDonald's but this place is ridiculous. Yeah, the kiosks are cool, but kind of pointless when you wait 15 minutes for your food."
222,1,1,This place gets 5 stars for the great customer service I experienced from Joe S. He was friendly and patient with me as I searched for the change I thought I had and when I couldn't find additional money he kindly put in the. 44 cents for me. He was also patient with who I believe was his coworker as he asked questions about meals and etc. The place was clean and moved quickly put the customer service was THE BEST.
289,2,2,Horrible!!! Waited so long for food. Zero stars. Terrible management. No clue about customer service. Food as brought out piece meal. Fries cold. Sandwich cold.  No apologies. No consideration. Complaints to manager were addressed with blank stares. We asked for refund. A good manager would have refunded partial of the bill and apologised profusely. This manager threw out the food and offered nothing for all the time wasted and frustration suffered.
290,3,3,Decent Mcdonalds. I wouldnt say there's anything special about it. Open 24 hours. Reason I give it 3 stars is because of the cleanliness of the place.
291,1,1,"Really surprised by the bad reviews. This is one of the best ones in the city, IMO. Very clean, spacious, comfortable seating. Everything is made fresh to order here, and they have those self kiosk machines where you can order your own food, too. Never had an issue here."
293,3,3,Clean and in a great location.   But the slow agonizing wait for a fast food joint.  Not impressed. .doesn't mean I won't be  back to fill my belly.
294,2,2,"It's 10:26.  Customer:  Are you serving breakfast?The McDonald's worker:  No, we stop serving breakfast at 10:30.  Customer:  It's not 10:30.  It's 10:26.  The McDonald's worker: Then we stop serving breakfast at 10:26.?!?!?!?!?!?!"
297,2,2,"One star for being opened 24 hours and another one for being clean and close to my apartment...This review is actually about the new Angus burger, I tried the bacon/cheese option and could not chew more than two bites.... Terrible, the word Angus is a good marketing get up but it does not deliver.I will stay away from fast food for at least another year after this experience"
299,1,1,McDonalds #11163 great services and employees. Excellent manager Carlos was very helpful and kind. Customers will definitely have a positive experience at this McD location.
300,1,1,Everything in my delivery was perfectly packaged and still warm with a surprise chocolate chip cookie included
301,2,2,Pretty standard with any McDonald's but make sure you have all your items before leaving! Had to go back twice because we were missing items in the bag
285,2,2,"Dirty floors. And slow service. This is supposed to be fast food. If you go here, check your order, they seem to leave stuff out."
303,2,2,"Twice now, this restaurant has served me a rotten egg in my McGriddle! Absolutely disgusting, and shows that the employees clearly don't care about poisoning their customers."
304,2,2,"The most disgusting McDonald's I've ever been to. The workers are lazy, rude and act like your bothering them. The food is always cold and thrown together and not fresh."
306,2,2,Extremely unsafe McDonald's.  Had visited several times over the past year in the early evening - lots of loitering outside by aggressive individuals.  Many homeless sleeping inside the restaurant and others are aggressively panhandling the customers both inside & outside.  Last night someone was shot dead outside this McDonald's around 10pm.  Do not visit here if you value your safety.
307,2,2,Bad service and the fries are always under undercooked. They don't acknowledge you or care about giving you a good experience.
288,2,2,"Huh?  How can your ice cream machine be out?!??!  That means no shakes, no ice cream cones, no sundaes.  This pregnant woman is not happy.  (Man behind the counter didn't show much remorse.)  And frappes can't be done with decaf coffee.  Bah!"
310,2,2,"Today. True Story.-I walked in and immediately regretted my decision because the local high schools just let out. Mistake #1.  -I weave through the crowds as well as crying children and ask about the free small coffee for ""National Coffee Day"" (as per news sources) and the woman says ""NOPE. NOT TODAY."" ........ K.-I order my co-worker's Ice Cream Sundae that she wanted and as my number is called a lady comes out of nowhere and snatches the ice cream and runs away.Happy National Coffee Day everyone!"
311,2,2,"Showed up at 3am and they were closed. Went to a bar... Came back around 5am... and they were still closed. The bald headed manager came out to tell us they were closed and as soon as I started recording they opened again. The woman at the register was extremely rude and so disgusting. The manager and the cashier started arguing about why he opened again. ""Why are they here?"" Is what she kept asking him. Ummm... excuse me... isn't this location 24/7?? If you don't want my money at this location let me know and I'll never come back but don't be shitty people to those coming in and respectfully wanting good service. I could not believe the level of customer service at this location. It was really horrible and the cashier is really a disgusting unprofessional person. It is outrageous the way she spoke to other customers and treated them. I cannot believe someone can be as unprofessional and nasty as her."
312,2,2,"The worst McDonald's I've ever been to.  Service was very slow, seemed robbed a a lot of new workers there. but what really blew me away what the manager (Stephanie) who came out  raging like a mad woman yelling and screaming to the top of her lungs  threatening to send workers home as if she was at home yelling at her 5 year old. She's so unprofessional and should not be the manager. There's so many other ways to get your employees to work faster."
313,1,1,"Not the fastest McDonalds, but one of the busiest! If you like your McDonalds extra crispy, here you go. Those nuggets were extra dark and edible. I'll go there plenty of times again if I'm in the neighborhood."
314,2,2,"This place is sketchy and chaotic. I came in at 8am to only have a guy start a tantrum yelling ""F*CK YOU LET ME USE THE BATHROOM"" until two cops had to show up. The cashiers look like they hate their lives and serve with the most unpleasant face expression. In fact, my cashier got pissed off I didn't hear her the first time she told me my food was ready. I specifically asked for 6 cream on the side for coffee, but they put like one cream in and thought that was good enough. At least their free wi-fi is good enough for me to use it an write this review on how crappy this place is. If you want any sort of decent food and service try the many restaurants within half a mile to mcdonalds."
315,2,2,"More employees are needed especially in the early AM. No matter how early you get there, they always make you late for work. McDonald's makes enough money to hire more people. MADHOUSE!""  This is ridiculous..."
316,2,2,"do not go after midnight, food is not fresh i just threw up my chicken sandwich.. and for the past week they did not clean their oil that they cook their fries in! black stuff all over fries it looks like black pepper but it's not it from old grease! (for a whole week same nasty stuff)guess this was my cue to not eat late and to stop eating mcdonald's period"
318,2,2,"First time in Brooklyn area, McDonald's employees are nasty to customers.  I ate there and want to use restroom and it's lock up, so I ask she told me is only for customer only.  This is getting ridiculous here, am I a customer, so why I can't use restroom here.  Very poor services, need to retrain this people how to treat your customer.  If it like that with nasty attitudes who want to go to McDonald's in Brooklyn's area.  NOT ME!"
319,2,2,One word: Dirty!
320,1,1,"I am embarrassed to admit it, but I went to McDonalds 3 times in one day.. on Thanksgiving. Twice in 2 hours at this specific location. I can already feel the judgement and you are probably thinking what would I ever order as a pescatarian?!  I had a wonderful thanksgiving dinner, but what was missing was dessert. As you can imagine we couldn't find any bakeries opened nearby. I have an EXTREME sweet tooth and I was determined. After drinking a generous amount of wine, my partner and I stumbled into McDonalds. We were thrilled this location had touchscreens you could order/ pay from.. No line & no human interaction = a millennials dream. We ordered our usual dessert that never fails: a vanilla soft serve icecream, Oreo McFlurry, sodas, and a chocolate chip cookie. Buzzed me was feeling adventurous and wanted to try the apple pie. I have always HATED apple pie and have refused to touch it, so this was very out of character. Let me tell you.. the apple pie crumbled on top of my soft serve vanilla ice cream in a cup was a game changer. It was so good that I had to go back and order another an hour after I finished my dessert. My second visit I noticed a snicker doodle mcflurry that I swear wasn't an option an hour before on the same touch screen. I ordered a snack size version of that, but found it too sweet even for me. Wouldn't get it again. Also, my chocolate chip cookie was hard as a rock, so would normally subtract a star. However, my new dessert combination is a game changer for me and my life will be forever changed now for the better thanks to this experience. Thank me later. Also this McDonalds is open 24/7 with super nice employees who didn't even publicly shame me for coming back in less than 1 hour!!"
321,3,3,"I am giving this spot only 3 stars because I didn't like the location. The food that was served to us was incorrect. I understand mistakes do happen. When we show you that we ordered a burger it means that we didn't order hot cakes.Granted it wasn't the clerks fault but she was rude about it. So, I'll never visit this location again. I did like the fact that the place was cleaner than more fast food chains. The other customer service were completely kind."
322,1,1,I came in year yesterday for a snack to take on the train ride home. It aas rather empty a bit before 5. I ordered 2 chicken tenders and a small order of French fries. I was asked what kind of sauce I wanted. I asked for sweet and sour sauce.My food was ready relatively quickly. I never had the tenders before and I waz glad they didn't look too small. It went great with the sweet and sour sauce. So did the French fries actually.
323,3,3,"I used to come here as a kid with my parents and I used to be full of homeless people asking for money. For me, as a kid, I was kind of scared because random people would come up to me to ask me for money. As I grew up I learned to understand why they were doing that but I felt like the location there just had an overload of people asking for money or making a ruckus at that location. Their food was average but there was never a place to sit so we would always have to take it to go. The only thing I would recommend is to try and control the amount of loitering."
324,2,2,"This location isn't the best, especially at night. It's much more unruly-homeless people/people yelling at each other. The nuggets were soggy and missed that golden crisp I love. Got a fresh batch of French fries but they were somehow soggy too! Wish they were crisp like I remember them being!"
325,2,2,"Sadly this branch serves less quality burgers than other branches.. I used to order fillet o fish burger often in other mc Donald stores but when I experienced getting it from them, got a trauma. Sooo dry and hardly had a sauce in it.  The plain mc chicken patty is really good in other branches but in theirs, it's so peppery and could barely find lettuce in it.. so disappointed.. hope they see this review so they can improve.. I like their new place though.. more organized and cleaner.."
326,2,2,"SMH!!!!!! On Wednesday, June 5, 2019, between 11:20-11: 50 am I met one of my friends here. I order a meal with my debit card, sat down with her toddler son, and ate. Afterward, I dumped my garbage and walked over the restroom entrance. I noticed the door had to be buzzed open and turned towards the register area and was trying to get the attention of a female Hispanic or Latina employee on a ladder.  ALL I ASKED HER WAS, ""Could I use the bathroom?""  Miss THANG had the AUDACITY to look at me and say, ""Can't you see that I'm on a ladder?""  WHOA!!!!  I was shocked!!!!  I walked back over to the counter and ask her was there a problem because all I ask was could I used the bathroom.  Another female Hispanic or Latina was laughing when she said it and had to nerve to tell me to go ahead and use it.  Then a few others came out and they were trying to tell who I noticed was a manager what happened.  I called her over and ask her what was wrong with her.  She tried to minimize the problem and I had to remind her who was the PAYING customer!!!!!!!  SMH!!!!  Laughing????  All her nasty behind had to do was call someone to hit the buzzer behind the counter with her MOUTH!!!!  DUHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!Customers are the reasons you even get a paycheck!!!!  Never bite the hand that feeds you!!!!"
327,1,1,I'm a bit of a health nut so I try not to go to McDonald's if I can help it however my son does love their their chicken nuggets and it's affordable when you're in a rush and you don't have any options and you have to hurry and I can't say that the food is not delicious most things that are not good for you are delicious however they do have healthy options they have chicken salads and they have smoothies mango strawberry fruit smoothies as well I love deer iced hazelnut coffee it's affordable and it's just as delicious as Starbucks and Dunkin donuts if not better
328,2,2,"The service so bad,this is da worse McDonald's I go,the lady wear grey shirt not polite and they look work hard but don't know what they doing,no customers service, only the blue shirt lady kind of nice,the grey shirt kind of mean"
329,2,2,"This location is the worst. The food is always cold and everytime I've ordered the chicken nuggets i have to check and return them and today was no different. I ordered my food and returned the nuggets because they were cold. The guy tells me no they just made them they're hot. I said NO! The box is hot because y'all keep the empty boxes under the oven so it feels as though the food is hot but i opened these and they're old and cold. He then goes to speak to his coworker in spanish about the nuggets. So i asked him what was he sayin and he said it was about the food, but i have a feelong there was xtra. If they stop being sneaky this could be a great location"
330,2,2,Lot of homeless people hanging out in here. The place is extremely slow and place is dingy
331,2,2,"After being a customer, they would not let you use the restroom. Their excuse? ""A truck is unloading, their for, restroom is out of service.I did not now the truck unloads in their bathroom!"
332,2,2,This is the worst managed McDonald's on the planet. It is the reason people hate McDonald's.
334,2,2,"This place is horrible.  It deserves 0 stars, but unfortunately Yelp does not offer that as an option.  I got horrible food poisoning from eating here and needed to be hospitalized.  The management was extremely unresponsive about the issue.  Additionally, this location is dirty (they allow dogs inside), loud, and rowdy.  By eating here you are definitely risking your health and wellbeing.  DO NOT COME HERE."
335,2,2,"This McDonald's has been in the neighborhood for years and unfortunately, it has only gotten worse as time has passed. The food is below average and will take forever to be made, even if you are the only person waiting to be served. I would definitely avoid this McDonald's at all costs."
336,3,3,Very slow service people r waiting for food. Other then as usual Mack lover. Hope it will grow up there service.
337,2,2,"I live around the area and when I'm really hungry at a late hour I come here. Also, I can get coffee here for $1. Basically the worse customer service in history. People working there look so depressed and sleepy. Or they look angry that life made them work there. Either way, you wait in line for awhile as there are bums in the background asking people for change."
338,2,2,"Food is rarely fresh, never got good tasting fries in this McDonald's. What I thought I liked was the delivery option this location carries. Don't be mistaken, comes all smushed, cold and steamed (and late). If you have time, walk to the 3rd avenue location."
343,1,1,"Stopped by to pick up the pokemon happy meal because apparently they're selling out of the playing cards or the Pikachu boxes at other McDonalds locations in New York City. They had a lot left, it was a quick process for ordering and picking up. Had no issues with their customer service or my order either."
302,2,2,"The laziest, most incompetent employees.  Ordered Double Big Mac.  The idiot that compiled the sandwich ingredients just threw everything haphazardly into the lower half of the burger and placed the middle bread just underneath the top bun.  Put in a minuscule amount of sauce and lettuce.  Will not go back again."
345,3,3,"Alright location, yellow line and the 6 train aren't too far of a walk. Quite a few tables and seats. One gender neutral washroom downstairs and decent sized but no mirror, a bit wet for the floor but it's alright, quite a few toilet paper on the floor. Definitely not the worst I've seen but can surely be cleaner or at least smell cleaner. Staff wasn't too friendly and kind of cold but wasn't too rude either. There's a second floor too but the close that up and most chairs are on the tables and organized at later hours."
346,2,2,"The phone is off the hook at McDonald's the phone in order to order is off the hook duck u, fuck u, fuck u, fuck u, there is it long enough now?"
214,2,2,"I waited over half an hour for an order of chicken nuggets. Just to get home and find that they put 4 nuggets in a 6-piece container. I have never been to a slower, more poorly managed McDonald's location in my life. I worked at McDonald's for a long while, it's not that hard. Don't waste your time going here."
348,3,3,"This McDonalds is OK - much better than the one on West 4th in term sof customer service and efficiency. The interior is pretty clean with lots of seating on the lower level. The upper level used to be open all the time but in my recent visits here, I've noticed they closed it off. I guess it makes sense to save on the cleaning. One thing that annoys me is when the customers form one line down the center and we get yelled at to form 2 lines. This makes NO sense because often times, the in line you choose out of the 2, you end up behind someone slow and frustratingly watch people who arrive after you on the other line order before you even do. Just let us make the 1 line and everyone can be fairly served based on when they get on line. Overall pretty standard McDonald's in the area with the regular menu items and the ability to use physical coupons or coupons off their mobile app."
349,3,3,"This is a super busy McDonalds.  I appreciate how they keep the quality up despite being one of the Manhattan locations that doesn't have touchscreens yet.  They need more bathrooms, touchscreen ordering, customer-filled fountain drinks, and more seating.  The seating issue could be fixed by leaving the second floor dining area open more of the time, but it wouldn't be accessible to people in wheelchairs.  Somehow these guys stay friendly and keep the food fresh despite the pressure."
350,2,2,"Man, I'm not expecting much from McD but this was extra bad. I order nothing but a small fries, wait 10-15 mins...I should have asked a lot sooner, but at that point I asked: what's going on with the fries?The lady says (direct quote) ""why didn't you say something?"" And starts cooking fries at that moment, literally 15 minutes after I ordered.Unreal. At that point I walked out and lost my $2.09."
351,2,2,"This is the worst experience I have ever had at any fast food restaurant. Our order was taken incorrectly, when we realized cashier argued back and did not want to order us what we actually wanted. Once we received food, the breakfast sausage was burnt and chicken tenders were missing. Needed to use the bathroom but there was no toilet paper and it was disgusting. Security guard would not allow me to use any other bathroom. I was appalled that as a customer I was denied. Would never go back."
352,1,1,"This mcdonald's in particular is one of the best in the NYC area, with its freshly fried nuggets, each bite is a salty, crunchy and juicy delight."
353,1,1,"I walked into this downtown McDonald's on a Friday evening to find the usual scene: a few couples grabbing a quick bite, some teenagers getting ready for a night on the town, and a dead man sitting in a booth by the window.I got in line, which went fairly quickly, ordering a ten piece McNugget meal with fries and a Dr. Pepper. After the cashier took my order, I said, ""you know, it's none of my business, but there's a dead guy in that booth over there."" She stared at me blankly and handed me my receipt.As I waited for my order, I wandered over to the dead man's booth and confirmed that he was indeed a cold, lifeless body. I decided to give him a name: Gene. Gene's final meal was spread out over the table in front of him: medium fries, a soda, ten piece McNuggets and barbecue sauce. I went back to the counter to pick up my meal. ""You want barbecue sauce?"" I paused. ""No thanks,"" I said. ""Better go with the honey mustard.""I sat down at an empty table and ate my meal. The bright, fluorescent lighting gave the place a sterile, industrial feel. A top 40 playlist crooned over the loudspeaker. After a few minutes, Gene's festering corpse fell from its upright position and collapsed into booth next to him. It was a fairly busy night, and I counted about a dozen people who came and went as and ate my nuggets. I had one left when a young woman entered. She walked past Gene's body, and did a double take. A look of confusion swept across her face. She scanned the room nervously, and we locked eyes. For a brief second, we became members of a dark conspiracy. In the other's eyes, we gazed into the grey abyss of existence. She nodded silently. I picked up my tray, and left the McDonald's. Overall, pretty standard McDonald's. Clean bathrooms. Make sure to ask for ketchup, they don't give it to you unless you ask."
354,2,2,"UGH....This place gets worse and worse everytime I come here.  #3 (Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese) no Pickles, with Coke.IS THAT SO FUCKING HARD?he writes up no onions.  What do I get?  A chicken sandwich.It says it right on the TAG you printed, ON THE BOX.Seriously, you guys want a raise?  Fucking graduate High School first."
355,2,2,I went and bought a bacon egg & cheese biscuit meal to go. Of course when I get to work the biscuit is so hard I couldn't bite into the sandwich. I had to eat the bacon egg & cheese alone. I know it's fast food but make the food edible. Not going back to this McDonald's!!!
356,2,2,"The manager was very rude to me. I asked a question and he was very rude with his response. Then proceeded to scream ""yo"" at me. He was very rude and I will not be coming back here ever again."
357,2,2,"One person, breakfast, first time buying at this restaurant. Take out. No wait.Another day, another mickie D's review. This one is even worse than last time albeit I was not in the best of conditions healthily. Sick, I bought big breakfast with hot cakes. Asked what the latter was and the cashier gave a demeaning, condescending answer, what are you saying? This is a touristy part of town, miss, and I don't exactly look like I belong here, do I?I came back to the office to eat this hot, nice smells came to nose. Except I was hung over and kept throwing up so didn't eat till lunch. By then, the hash brown was cold and by warming it up, I gave up the crispness. Everything was bland, even the sausage. Pancakes/hot cakes were okay though. Two stars. Apple pay accepted yay!"
359,2,2,"This review may sound really dramatic, but it's about as accurately as I can put it. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that I went at around 1am. So I might only be referring to the late service. This McDonald's is the worst McDonald's I have ever had, anywhere in the entire world. The service was awful and the food was even worse. Firstly it's a mess physically (which isn't uncommon in NYC, though) food splattered on the floor, unwiped tables, etc. Secondly, the waitress/lady at the cashier literally yelled at us to come up and order and keep in mind the previous person had just finished ordering and she literally yells ""NEXT NEXT NEXT"" in the most condoning way and suggests with her hands that we need to hurry. Completely unnecessary as it was almost empty and it's a 24 hour McDonald's. Anyways, while we were ordering one of my friends even forgot to order one of their items because of how much pressure this waitress had put on her to order and then she didn't give us a receipt AND almost skipped my other friend behind us by rushing... At this point I thought okay, the food will make up for it. I mean.. it's MCDONALD'S, the antidote to all bad situations. Boy was I wrong, as soon as I put one fry in my mouth I knew it was game over. It literally tasted like it was reheated in the microwave after being cold for hours, I say this out of experience. I could barely get the fry down my throat, you best believe I did not touch the fries after that first one. The burger was awful according to my friend, I can't speak further on that. The chicken nuggets, what a catastrophe. They were hard yet soft and it was quite hard to bite them yet they were really damp and chewy. Honestly disgusting. McNuggets are supposed to be great, not made out of hate."
360,3,2,"Open late, very cheap especially with the app! They didn't have fries though at this time, and breakfast items took at least 15 minutes"
361,2,2,"The credit card machine is always not working. It's always cash only. No matter how much you complain, nothing is changed. Unbelievable!!"
362,2,2,"This place is SO slow. Employees have major attitude. Last time I ordered food, they either forgot to call my number or, possibly, called my number and I didn't hear them, but they let my food sit on the counter for a long time and they never tried to call the number again. Eventually I asked them if the food on the counter was my number, and they said ""I dunno what is it?"", expecting me to thumb through the order. Fortunately it was mine, otherwise I would have put my hands all over someone's food. Only reason it isn't one star is because it wasn't a nightmare experience or anything, just generally unpleasant and slow."
363,1,1,I like how McDonald is updating their stores.  The stores now look more modern and similar to a cafe.I rarely ever eat at McDonald since New York City has a tons of cheap food that offered better quality.  However my friend and I stop here for the buy one get one free Big Mac deal during memorial day weekend since both of us didn't have one in years.  The major reason that I give this place four stars is the quality of the Big Mac.  I wish I took a picture because the sandwich look exactly like they do in the commercials.  It was a perfectly made sandwich in the fast food industry.By no means it is quality food however it was great for what it is.  Don't think eating McDonald's will make you fat.  Just watch what you eat and just exercise.
364,2,2,Iced coffee with a side of attitude. You bet. Got a huge attitude from the woman behind the counter for asking for Splenda in my coffee.
365,2,2,"I have never seen such a poorly maintained McDonalds.  Broken tables, lights flickering like a horror movie and the denizens.... Really sketchy.  I interrupted what appeared to be a drug deal as I opened the front door.  Just an armpit.  Avoid."
366,2,2,"One of the worst. So slow even when it's not busy. I ordered a ""#1"" and they gave me just the sandwich.  I tell the cashier and she says ""you have to say #1 combo."" Ffs. Really? Minus the fact it took 15 minutes to get a single burger with no drink, fries, etc. There are always homeless people at the door, inside...and they never tell them to leave as if afraid or just don't care. McD corporate needs to take away franchise license or completely overhaul staff and management. This place is trash."
367,2,2,"Very unprofessional customer service. I walked in to this location on July 12, 2017 at 1:30pm and purchased a meal. I waited 18 minutes for my meal. I asked one of the employees for the status of my meal and was given a rude response.  No one in the restaurant assisted, but began to to speak Spanish to there other associates while ignoring my request.  I asked for a refund and the manager gave me a hard time. This is not what I expected to experience in this establishment."
368,3,3,"A group of about seven of us stumbled in here at 4 in the morning for a early breakfast/late night snack. The place was extremely full. Service was slow, but I can understand, the people probably felt miserable with all the drunken halloween partiers"
370,2,2,"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Like other reviewers have mentioned, there are a ton of low lives/bums who hang out here. They leave trash all over, harass the other people who come in, and the overall place is dirty. Shame on the manager for not maintaining better up keep. The food was good and came relatively quickly but it's not even worth it to come inside."
371,2,2,"Firstly, this mcdonalds has a cool design. Resembles a cafe. The service is horrible though. Been there 3 times and every time you can't even tell where the lines are (unorganized), they should invest in those things to put up in front of the registers so you know who's first and whatnot. I also had to spend 10 minutes out of my 30 minute lunch break trying to get my money that they overcharged me back. Spoke to the manager and she REFUSED to give it back even with an employee yelling at her to do so (because it was obvious that I was overcharged)Will not be going back there"
372,2,2,"The slowest mcdonalds I've been to in my life. Fries are often cold. Most ""managers"" are unbelievably rude. If you want to meet Bon Qui Qui from ""King Burger"" from the Mad TV tv show, just come here. You won't be able to tell the difference."
374,2,2,Worst place ever. Rude staff...was told by Rasheeda that they were almost closing and denied me my food because it was almost closing time. Yet they had a full staff. Called the owner of the location with no response. Don't eat here.
375,2,3,Closed and they turned the lights off so when you look inside it's not the same anymore.
376,2,2,"Avoid this McDonald's at all cost. It has got to be one of the worst McDonald's I have ever been to.Honestly, the workers are pretty good. They are trying their best to deal with the crowds and get people their food. There is table service and computer kiosks for ordering at this McDonald's but unfortunately it does not enhance the McDonald's experience. We waited a really long time for our food and when it was brought to our table it was either wrong or missing some items. The lady apologized and asked us if we were willing to substitute food. Sure, whatever. It was really no big deal.However, it is the crowd I have a problem with. A group of ghetto teenagers (maybe about 15 total) caused a ruckus throwing chairs and cursing while we were there. Imagine this, the elderly, babies, and families in the middle of a brawl. Mall security wouldn't dare stop what was going on or enter McDonald's. Cops wouldn't even show up. What McDonald's did have was a very stern manager and front line employees yelling at the kids to stop it and get out. They really stuck to their guns and I'm thankful to these ladies for doing their best to protect the store and the customers.But sorry, never again and I suggest if you like eating in safety, don't come here."
377,1,2,"I ordered a burger with extra lettuce, hold the bun, hold the ketchup and please, no meat. When they gave it to me it resembled a salad far too much for my liking so I went without lunch that day."
378,2,2,"I wish I can rate this ZERO STAR if I could. The cashier's attitude was beyond disrespectful and nasty. I asked for 1 large fries, 1 small fries, 1 large soda and 1 mcchicken. When the cashier hand me the receipt, it says ""2 large fries, and 1 large soda. As you can tell, they missed the mcchicken. Then the cashier that did my order went inside and a different cashier came out to take her spot. I told the cashier that I only order 1 large fries, not 2, and I also ordered mcchicken but it's not on my receipt. The cashier turned around to the girl who did my order and said, ""you messed up her order."" The girl who did my order responded by saying ""That sh*t ain't my problem."" It was too late to change because my food just came and I don't want to argue with her. Just saying, if this McDonald's is going to pay these teens $14-$15 per hour, they should have better manners. Also there was one guy who is homeless, told me and my friend to get out because we are ""Asians"". He said ""your eyes are so small, how can you see"" (making small circles around his eyes to mock us)."
379,2,2,"Tip 1) if you are at the Apple store across the way getting something repaired wondering where to go - do NOT go here.  Whole foods 365 has restaurants upstairs and hot bar downstairs.  This place is also literally an advertisement for shake shack which is 3 or 4 blocks away.  You have been warned.  Tip 2)  Order at the KIOSKS even if there is a wait - despite having to wait in line again if u are paying cash. Go KIOSK.  Tip 3) your chances of ever coming back will be low anyway - so why bother.  When would this food ever be worth this experience? They have people taking orders that don't say anything (staring at me for 3 seconds i had to ask if *they* were ready to take my order.  And you guessed it, she botched the order (did not repeat my order back to me).  Makes sense - put people at the registers who don't like to speak.  Perfectly fine human being, bad management.  Waited for 20 minutes, did not hear my number, nor was it anywhere on the computer screen which displays orders.  But apparently it had been back there the whole time.  The (assistant manager?) basically gave me some serious hand wave and fast walkaway saying she called my number ""twice"".  I asked for a fresh meal which she finally did provide.  So, I am guilty of going to McDonalds - that is what i felt like just being there.  awesome.  At least they didn't charge me for the side of Sass.  BTW, ive been plenty of 'super ghetto' mcd's - Central Harlem, Brownsville, Bronx and plenty of other cities.  Nothing was ever this bad as far as the quality of the employees.  This is the worst MCD I've experienced in NYC, although admittedly i would never step foot in one after 7pm FWIW. If this were my company id just NUKE this entire effing franchisee.  Its far too small a location (unruly customers plus a cattle auction atmosphere) and too many employees dont want to be there, a manager that clearly cant keep this place together.  Bring in / rotate a team from other locations.  This location totally ruins the corporate brand.  Ive never wished for robots as much as i did today.  However catch 22 - im pretty certain an AI bot visiting this location will ponder the need for our existence as a species.  Thanks McDonalds - you have also made me frightened for singularity."
380,2,2,"Not good at all. Soda was flat and no one cares. Bugs flying around. And they tried to charge for ketchup $1.50 at the register. Started at the order here machine and couldn't get past to pay because couldn't find one of those table numbers but my total was $12.60 so went to the register and order same thing and it came to $14.60. I ask the lady behind the register why at the machine it was cheaper, she mumble something and the price went back to $12.60. Look at the receipt and she took off charge for 3 ketchup. Amazing they are ripping people off because lots of people don't look at the receipt and I would not have known if I started straight at the register. How many people have they ripped off and how much have they made? 100 people a day is $150 x 365 = $54,750 a year - nice chunk of change."
381,2,2,"If I can, I would have rated a 0! Very bad experience two times already! The first time was, my friend had placed her order and were waiting there for 30 min.! So my friend asked the lady, the lady got really bad attitude. She was complaining she had called the number and we were not there. Which clearly she did not call the number because we were standing right there waiting for the food. The second time was today, I had placed my order and ready to paid, I was going to use the deal from the app, but this b* looks at the QR code and done nothing ! It cost like 21 something, and I gives her 22. This b* did not give me back the rest of my change. Which I didn't bother to ask after, cause I was not in a mood to get into a fight with her! Really bad experience, and would not go back ever again! If u don't want ur day to be ruin, just don't walk in to this place"
382,2,2,"Today I dined here with my group of 20 band/choir students. We placed a large order of about $200, so it was important we assured all food items were received. In short, the manager on duty was extremely unhelpful and demonstrated a poor level of customer service. It seemed that he just wanted to get rid of me and my students - paying customers - rather than assure that our order was filled correctly. I suggested that we receive our items, and then step outside to disperse them to my students, and double check the receipt to confirm we received all items - all of this so that our large group would be out of the way in the already busy restaurant.  He continuously told us that if we left the restaurant with our food items that the location would not be liable for any missing items. We then moved to check off the items at the counter, and the manager rushed through this process. When I questioned his certainty on us receiving all of the food, he became snippy and flippant, rather than meeting my concerns with positive customer service. Another wonderful employee, BRITTANY, saw the issue and poor process happening and proceeded to disperse our food to the students one-by-one - a much more efficient method that I would have expected the manager to lead. During this we discovered MANY ITEMS WERE MISSING, and she simply called to the crew staff to make sure we got them. All the while, the manager watched over her shoulder, commenting on the missing items as if my students and I intended to steal food that we had already paid $200 for. This experience was a nightmare and not at all the level of customer service I expect in retail. I understand that large orders and groups are daunting, but those occasions should be met with HIGHETENED kindness and efficiency, not an attitude or sloppy, inefficient processes. When we left the store, we realized that after all of the above we STILL DID NOT RECEIVE ALL OF THE ITEMS. I was so frustrated with the experience that I did not even bother to return to get them - it honestly was not worth the headache at that point. PLEASE BEWARE ordering here. The store is always busy, and the leadership does not seem to have a handle on quality customer service approaches.THANK YOU BRITTANY for your superior customer service and improvisation in a hectic moment. NO THANK YOU, MANAGER."
383,2,2,"Where do I even begin? The person at the cash register seemed to have the biggest attitude problem while I made my order. It seemed as though I was inconveniencing her by being here. The food took to ridiculously long to come out, and this was not during a rush, there were only a couple other customers in the store with us. No one informed us of, or apologized for there being an unnaturally long wait. The staff was overall unprofessional, making jokes and having full blown conversations with each other, with their backs turned to the registers. The entire time, I got the impression that the customers showing up somehow ruined whatever it was that they were doing, and they just wanted us to all leave, with or without our orders. This was by far the worst fast-food experience I've had in this city, and I will not be coming back here."
384,2,2,"No service whatsoever!! That African American girl give zero-shit service and excusing me of yelling  at her! The line the restroom is unbelievable 'LONG' because three employees were standing forming a line and chatting before they can go and enjoy their restroom break. Fantastic! Don't you see customers(two kids) are waiting?????!!!!!!! Please, please, please....... train your employees before releasing them"
385,3,3,"Due to its location in the mall, you can expect a full house or large lines.  The restaurant is poorly constructed so it will seem like there's one line, but you'll soon hear from one of the cashiers that there are three lines. Thankfully, they move pretty quickly and have a system that works. You place your order on your right and pick it up on the left. Bon appetit!"
386,2,2,"Slowest service ever.  Waited over 15min for a cheeseburger happy meal.  When I got there the line was minimal ( only 2 people in front of me).  It wasn't busy at all.  By the time I left the line was long people after me got served, and left.  When I asked about what happened to my order "" it is just a cheeseburger happy meal burger.  Burger fries and drink these are staples and should be on stand by""  the idiot looked at the food area and handed it to me.  My next question should have been how long was it sitting there that no one knew it was there.  But I had a train to catch pure incompetence.  And for this they want 15 an hour.  How about better service then we could talk"
388,2,2,"Came in at 9:00am for breakfast. Tried to get the dollar menu Sausage McMuffin with round egg. Cashier charges me for the meal. No, I wanted the dollar menu McMuffin. Angrily, she re-rings up the order and says theres no such thing as the dollar menu. I rarely eat at McDonalds, so I guess I didn't know. Maybe they should update their menu then. But more importantly, don't come at your customers with bad attitudes. What do they care anyway..."
389,2,1,"McDonald's is one of the many reasons why I detest the Atlantic Mall.  Usually, I end up at McD's because I didn't eat anything before shopping and I refuse to pay for Applebees.  Or, I'm waiting for the LIRR train and as usual, I didn't eat before I have to travel.Tonight, I was just shoppng at my new guilty pleasure, Target.  Going down the elevator, I knew I had to eat something and I resigned myself to McDonalds.   I look at the menu and when I was finally called, I told the worker what I wanted.  ""The McDouble is not a dollar, we don't have a dollar menu"" said he.  I snottily told him that I didn't ask him if it was a dollar, I want my damn McDouble, hop to it.    He did not hop, he crawled over to the soda machine and with an air of resignation, looked at the other people working.   The drugs I'm taking for my sinus infection must be really good because I thought the whole scene was hilarious.  Loud little children, shrieking, trying to be cute and annoying the hell out of me were there.   I got my food and sat down near some white kids, one asian and one of the white girls' mom.    Those little yuppie bitches was eyeing people up and down.  OH my gawd, we are in a ghetto enclave!   I rolled my eyes as I looked at the expressions of snobbish fear played on their faces.  Those little wenches were ordering their mother around, I wanted to slap them in the faces and tell them to get shit their own damn self and that their mother wasn't there to cater to their every whim.  That woman was frazzled.   While this was happening, I'm eating my McDouble.    It was GOOD!  I was really surprised.   It was the best tasting McDouble I have ever had.The neighbor hood has changed.  All neighborhoods surrounding the Atlantic Mall are gentrified or almost on their way.  It's going to be interesting how this pans out.   Atlantic Mall is now an excellent place to observe the changes in the community.   As far as McDonald's goes, well if enough Yuppies go there and complain, we'll be having a well run McDonalds."
390,2,2,"This review is specifically about the McDonalds in the Atlantic Mall on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. This is by far the worst managed fast food restaurant in the country. Because of it's small size compared to other McD's, you would think the manager of this one would recognize the importance of organized service. Though kids will love it here (mainly because it's so zoo like), adults will tear up and long for the good old days when customers were important and not treated like cattle. The cashier's all have major attitude problems, as if they are looking for a fight!. All I want is a friggin fish samich for Pete's sake!Run upstairs to Target to their Starbucks for something to tide you over until you can get home, but stay away from this McNightmare."
391,2,3,"This particular location has the rudest staff in the world.  In the several of times that I've been there,  the cashier will walk off to get everyone else's food, without fail, whenever it's my turn up in the line.  One time- while finally being able to order and already paid -the cashier got everything ready except for my fries and walked off saying that more needed to be made, which was true.  However, as soon as the next batch was ready, she was nowhere to be found.  Then other cashiers went there to get fries.  I told one of them that all I needed was a large fries in my order and asked whether they could help me out because my cashier was nowhere to be found.  Her reply, ""you're going to have to wait for her to get back"".  Then another cashier asked her what I said and replied, ""that guy said something, but I didn't hear a thing.""When my cashier finally returned, the same cashier specifically wouldn't let her get any fries.  So I had to wait for that cashier to eventually use up all the fries and for another batch to be made.This place is beyond appalling.  Even the Mcdonalds' in the ghettoest of ghettos that I've been to provide better service than this hell hole.  Bottom line: they'll treat you like the scum of the earth if you don't look and act similar to them.I'd give no stars if I could."
392,2,1,"In liu of spending all my dough at starbucks for a frappuccino, I sometimes head inside the atlanic mall for an ice cream cone at this very friendly and well run mcdonalds.   Oh wait. Did I say that?Sometimes I don't even want the ice cream, I just wanna see if I can't top my last miserable experience at the worst mcdonalds in the universe. I always do.  I'd tell you that I feel like a winner if I weren't dripping tears in my cone"
393,2,2,"the worst mcdonalds in the country, stay away, staff never listen to your order, always seem to be having there own conversation.  store is always out of something, for example, tea bags, cream, milk, splenda, sugar and milk,  recently the have been out of mcdonald coffee.  i have been given a cup of hot water without a tea bag.  this location is bringing down the brand"
394,3,3,"(based on visits between May and October of 2015)Small and crampedBut then again, this is an EXPRESS McDonalds, which means it is not designed to handle large crowds. If you need dining space take the (C) at nearby Spring Street to the McDonald's at West 3rd across from 7-eleven.And as it is express, I'm never left to wait for long when making even the tallest of orders. Breakfast ends one hour early at this location and it does have a drive-thru. There is only one restroom, and sometimes it's unusable. But when they have the time they're pretty good at cleaning it.Between 2 and 4 PM, there is an occasional rash of people making tall orders without paying for them. They tend to clog the queue (yellow background), impairing the ability of those who have paid (green background) to get their orders processed faster. Mornings are best.This location DOES have a drive thru."
396,3,1,"Though I had lived there for many years & enjoyed many once in a lifetime experiences, I had to leave NYC some time ago to relocate to the midwest.  On return trips I've made since, I've made a point of visiting either my favorite places or those that have some random cultural significance (at least in the mind of a child of the 1980s).  This McDonald's Express is one of those places.While it may not look the part, it was the building exterior used for Pete's Luncheonette in the movie The Muppets Take Manhattan.  The same exterior was used as the diner for the pilot of Seinfeld.  While I generally avoid McDonald's unless Shamrock Shakes are in season or there's a happy meal toy I MUST have.  This was different.  Released in 1984, The Muppets Take Manhattan was as fun in its own way as Ghostbusters, or Purple Rain would be in theirs.  The Muppets visit Pete's when they're hungry & want some soup, but they leave Kermit behind once they come to feel they're too much of a burden on him while he tries to mount a Broadway show.  Kermit winds up getting a job working alongside the lovely Jenny, Pete's daughter.The location's current tenant is not really the place one would go to realize their dreams, though you could fall asleep waiting in line (So much for the ""Express"" labeling).  I last visited in search of a Star Wars toy.  Seating on the ground floor is minimal & the upper level was closed off, almost as if they don't want customers to linger.Aside from its historical connection to the Muppets, I had little reason to."
397,1,3,"Any size sweet tea is still $1. There are two floors with seating upstairs. They do advertise a few specials unlike other Manhattan locations. I came for the sweet tea that was perfect. Sometimes they forget to add the ""sweet"" but this location didn't! Oh yea, none of the employees were rude which is a plus!"
398,2,2,This is supposed to be an express location- trust me there is nothing express about it. I waited forever for a ten piece nuggets and fries. I had to throw my soda out because it tasted completely like seltzer. My fries were soaked with grease and inedible! My nuggets too were sooo greasy. I've never experienced this at a mcdonalds before. So disgusting! And the ketchup packets they put in my bag were covered in some unidentifiable sticky residue. Definitely stay away from this location.
399,2,2,It's always there bathroom problems even for there cosmers This is why u deserve 1 star
400,2,2,"Came here late at night. The food's decent and I got it fast, but the workers seem really out of it and the location at night is useless as a place to sit down with some food. Barely any seating at night since the upstairs portion is closed off, and the bathrooms are shut down as well. I kept hearing a lady yelling at and putting down the workers, guessing she was a manager or supervisor, which is no way to communicate with your employees."
401,2,2,"Total chaos.  Tons of people standing around.  Have they ordered?  Are they on line?  There's no way to tell.Set up some rope lines, please."
402,2,2,"We call this place the Homeless McDonald's. ""We"" being my office, since it's only a block away, and because it's a pretty accurate depiction of the clientele that comes here. I am thankfully not homeless, but I have come here out of shame and desperation, which is often accompanied by its own special vacancy otherwise reserved for self-respect.A few times a year, something stirs inside me that can only be satiated with greasy Chicken McNuggets and an over-salted order of Large Fries, and no matter how many other lunch spots I try to visit first, deep down, I know I'm always going to end up at this here Mickey Dee's. To their credit, the food is no better or worse than other McDonald's and the staff is typically quick and civil. But the counter is steps from the front door, which leads to a traffic jam of seedy and/or ashamed individuals to the point where any sort of order is impossible. Cutting would be a thing if a line was able to be formed in the first place. Just jump in, order, jump out, wait for food, leave. That's as orderly as it gets.It should also be noted that this is actually a McDonald's Express, which means it doesn't offer the full menu and you'll have to get your McFlurry fix elsewhere. There's also a second floor with extra seating, if you're feeling especially adventurous / depressed.When I've walked back to the office with that greasy, red and yellow bag in my hand, my co-workers have not only judged me because it's fast food (I've gotten everything from finger-pointing to ""Is everything OK?""), but because they know that I actually went to the Homeless McDonald's to get it. These are dark days, but I get by. I get by. . . ."
403,2,2,"In order to speed things up, the person packing the food basically flings them I to the bag and at the customer.  End result?  Half of the nuggets from thw box are scattered all over the bottom of the bag on top of other foods."
404,1,1,"This is an express, so they don't have a full menu, however the environment is really pleasant. The setting is mellow and the customer service is attentive."
405,2,2,"First McDonald's that I been to that they do not give your change. If I am supposed to get 2 pennies back, I will get 2 pennies in change. Money is not free. Also, they never give you the receipt, they should at least ask. And lastly, they always give you half the fries bag full."
406,1,1,"This may be my second favorite McD's location, despite the fact that it isn't really a full fledged McDonald's. It's an Express, but it's just so cute. How can you not love it? Cute. Tiny. Two Floors. No ODB. Oh, forget it. I'm going back to Philly."
407,3,3,"This is where I come when I'm hung over or when I just really need a fix of McNuggets. It's McDonald's, I know. I try so hard to hate it, but sometimes I just need it. The service here is usually quick and a lot of the employees are surprisingly friendly. The one big negative is the shady crowd that collects here late at night on weekends when SOB's empties out. Drunken idiots are stumbling in by the dozen, leaning against all of the walls and shouting about how badly they want their Filet-o-Fish. It's a mess."
408,2,2,Totally bad. Just dont go unless you are extremely hunger.
409,1,1,"Based on an September 2017 visitThe outside is full of beggars some of who are potentially persistent. Zero verbal interaction is much safer, believe me. The restroom is magnetically locked. Make sure it closes behind you when you're done. Beggars frequently render the restroom useless.I really enjoy the atmosphere of most McDonald's, especially since this isn't exactly a positive setting out front. But that's not their fault and the sales people here are more thoughtful than most. This is the alternative McDonald's I mentioned in another review if you need dining space but don't want to entirely leave SoHo.#NearbyTransitWest 4th Street (Subway)M55 to South Ferry. Limited stop here. The northbound route is on Broadway.The X1/7/8 coaches to Eltingville are a ten minute walk to West 9th Street. If you exit on the northern end of West 4th, the PATH train is just a block away.**This review was updated to remove unnecessary personal statements. Added transit context. Mentioned the mag-locked restroom.**"
411,2,2,"I came to this location to pick up breakfast. With the Covid-19 going on all restaurant workers supposed to wear masks. I places my order and I see one worker in the back ain't wearing making my order. I got uncomfortable and feeling unsafe. I ask for the manager for the refund she came over with nasty attitude and say "" WHY you want a refund"" nasty customer services Won't be coming back to this location"
412,1,1,"Fast service, great menu assortment. Restroom available on the second floor. Average prices for Manhattan area. The place is seems nice inside with a lot of available tables even during crowded hours. Also, staff were friendly and helped me throughout my order. I recommend you ordering through the app because the place is always crowded so you can get your food quickly."
413,2,2,I got there at 6:40am when on the door it say they open at 6am . I go to open the door(it's locked) and all the employees are just staring at me instead of saying something. So if u trying to get breakfast before work they don't open until after 6:40am.
414,2,2,This location is dirty. They blatantly ignore customers. The people behind the counter where on phone calls and not taking orders. Shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes to order at a McDonald's when I'm the only person in line.
415,2,2,"There was no AC when I went in a couple days ago when it was humid outside. The inside was hot and I couldn't wait to leave. Moreover service was unorganized! I ordered a meal and while my food was ready, I waited another good 5 minutes for my soda (I know 5 minutes isn't that long but this is a fast food place and I was in a rush expecting quick in and our service). I saw other people who came AFTER me who ordered at a different register get their drinks AS they were still paying while I was still standing there patiently waiting. As later order numbers were called and people went to pick up their food, they also got their drinks and even though I reminded the workers that I'm still waiting for my coke, they just brushed my request to the side. The place was generally clean, I haven't used their bathrooms before so I can't comment on the condition of that. Really, the only plus side is that it's right next to the West 4th St. Station."
416,2,2,"This felt like I would be ordering a Big Mac from a dirty, subway bathroom stall. So I didn't."
417,2,2,"Dear McDonald's,How is your cashier selling me a meal only for me to learn - after paying her - from the employee responsible for handing orders to customers waiting in the pick-up area/line, that there are no more fries AT EFFING ALL on your property? I was offered hash browns for the equivalent price (and I heard another customer being offered the same by the ""my"" cashier), but still. A rose is not a rose when we're talking about what type of potato to serve with a post-breakfast meal. It's a potato. It. Is. A. Po. Ta. To.So, the on-duty staff served up a memorable story for the few tourists and/or NYU international students to tell to their loved ones back home. I, however, was not amused. So, you're getting the Two-Star Magoo. 'Nough said. #TwoStarMagoo #NoughSaidSincerely,K.C.""Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt."" - African proverb"
418,2,2,All sunday group staff are trashy i ordered number6 aNd they dont give my juice and i complain but they're angry
419,2,2,"this place houses homeless people. some dude asked my friend and i if we were going to eat our food (before we even opened up our bags). i suggest u pregame this shit before coming here - will usually come to this location after a long night of clubbing. i always get the m&m mcflurry, however, their ice cream machine is always broken!!! either that or they'll shut off the machine at night. WHY?????? WHY WHY WHY"
420,2,2,"HA I honestly don't know why I even bothered. I've been to my fair share of bad McDonalds, but this place was just awful. When I first walked in, i immediately felt uncomfortable. This place is not clean, with sticky floors and used napkins all over the place. I noticed there were also a lot of homeless people, which is common in a lot of NYC McDonalds, but their loud and rowdy presence made me feel not comfortable to stay and eat. Not only was the environment of this location bad, but the food production was just down right bad. I ordered an egg white McMuffin, which I have ordered a dozen times before at other locations, but this one looked like it had just been slapped together in under 5 seconds. I'm so glad quality and presentation comes first, McDonalds. I most likely will not be back. The only reason why I had originally stopped in was because I was starving and wanted breakfast without paying a fortune around here. Lets just say, I've learned my lesson."
421,2,2,This is the worst consumer service ever. Come on sat dinner and want to order and the girl was super rude and I standed there 10 mins and she not even take my order and keep doing herself and even yelling me back
423,2,2,"OMG, 0 stars, ZERO!!!Without giving any bigger hints to my age, all I can say is, I remember when this place first opened for business.  It was a Hit- great location, clean, bright, and full of life.  Hell, Adam Sandler gave them a cameo in his Big Daddy movie.  I mean West 4th Street was the hang out spot years ago.  So much is always going on in the village.  However...Today, it's the pits...one of McDonald's WORST restaurants I've been to.  I was talking to my friend and paid no mind to the cashier, but when I was asked my order, I turned around to a full on Drag Queen.  I'm not lying.  This guy was fully made up with drawn on thick black pencil eyebrows, lashes, red lipstick, sparkling CZ earrings, foundation and blush, a wig (under his net).  It was a real Freak Show.  If I wasn't hungry, I swear, I would have left, and not just because of the show that was happening before me but because the main reason I was there in the first place was garbage.  Literally! I had to return my Fish Filet and have them make me a new one, because they tried to give me one that was old.  The bun was hard, the cheese was dried up, and the fish filet was gross.  Gladys, I think that's what her name is, the Manager, a tiny little Hispanic woman has zero control over the guys working there.  All of them look like they come from some half-way house or group home.  The cook went from cooking to taking the trash out.  And then back into the kitchen.  The weirdos walking in from off the street were coming to use the bathrooms, it was insane watching and listening to the conversations that were going on around me.  It was way too much for me, I finished up, trashed my food and drink and bolted outta there.This place will never ever in their life see me again.  RIP McDonald's I use to know."
424,2,2,Ruined flavored foods and impolite servers and the environments are bad. It was worst mcdonalds ever. Don't go this place.
425,2,2,How does a manager of a restaurant not allow a customer to use the restroom? And this bitch was proud to deny people quoting some NYC law that doesn't exist. It is disgusting and I hope she shits her pants next time she needs to go..
426,2,2,This one is actually on dirt. Late night they take cash only... so they can keep it. Probably cuz they aren't paid well... duh! But the food I got was old as hell. If you're going to steal from the mega conglomerate can you at least feed us fresh food? The consumers Aren't the ones effing you over.
427,2,2,"This McDonald's is downright scary. And to be fair, it's not their fault - it's West 3rd's fault. There are all types of crazy, homeless, drunken people here and it makes it VERY hard to actually eat here. Also the prices here are notably more expensive than basically any other McDonald's in New York. Not only is it more pricey, it gets even MORE expensive late at night to take advantage of the drunks coming from Fat Black PussyCat or Three Sheets. That's just predatory business - which I simply cannot support. Now let's talk about food. It's not good. And I don't mean not good overall, I mean not good for a McDonald's. It actually tastes like you're eating Grade D beef which is criminal. I want to be lied to when I eat McDonald's dammit.That being said, I'm currently about to go hard at Three Sheets Saloon to try and forget the horrible day I just had at work and I will more than likely be ordering from this Hell hole in about four hours. Such is life."
428,2,2,Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. The dining room is clean and the food is McDonalds standard but the staff is incompetent.I walked up to the counter the two cashiers were talking to each other about daycare something. Another customer was waiting until they finished. I ordered hotcakes for here. The cashier crumpled up my recipe and threw it away. Not that I wanted it this time but would have been nice to been asked. Never any eye contact.my hot cakes came to go. With 2 packets of ketchup and grape jelly. Do not come to this McDonald's until they change their staff.
429,2,2,"Went for the restroom, and was disappointed by the quality and service.They charged me for Mac sauce on my burger. There was no sauce on my burger."
430,2,2,"Who came to yelp because of the bad service? Looks like most of us!This location probably has the worst service in the entire nation, ...maybe the world? The staff look fairly young -teenagers, and with no manager supervising in the store late night. The cashier refuses to speak and just looks at you with the most miserable expression on her face. The customers ahead of me had been waiting on their fries for a long time and were getting impatient and angry. One of them got so angry with the useless staff on hand(who were not taking any responsibility and were instead chuckling at the customer's valid and reasonable complaint) -that he flipped over the cash register. lol. I liked the fact that the customer never cussed once at them though. He was just yelling reasonable things at them like, ""Why don't you do your job? And if you hate your job so much, go to college so you can get a better job."" That's excellent advice.If you want to witness the most depressed people on a job -go to this Mickey D's. Most likely the manager is to blame for this kind of ridiculousness. Those inept teenagers were annoying -but really, it's the manager who needs to get fired for not training them properly."
431,2,2,"IF ITS EVEN POSSIBLE, NEGATIVE FIVE STARS!1. Never get your order right, extra pickles doesn't mean NO PICKLES!2. So nasty and dirty, you don't wanna touch a thing! (And I mean A THING!)3. Extremely RUDE female manager and most of the staff. 4. HARD, COLD, OLD FRENCH FRIES EVERY TIME. 5. Extra for 1 bbq sauce??? Seriously? Does your dad own this Mcdonalds?6. Why do they never apply the dollar menu deals that I always see on T.V? Highway robbery I tell you."
344,3,3,"For McDonald's standards, it's ok. Not the worst, but could be better. Service speed ok and location looked fairly clean and updated. I got a McGriddle and sausage McMuffin with egg. The McGriddle was not dry. The McMuffin's English muffin was dry and a tad stale. I also found egg shells in the egg. I almost cut my gums. On the bright side at least I know they used real whole eggs."
433,3,3,Good McDonald's. Nice and clean when I came in (didn't use the bathroom though). Fast service. Not too many weird people. I ordered McNuggets and fries and a shake. The nuggets and shake were good but the fries were too crispy for my liking. Not the best McDonald's I've been to but would go back.
434,2,2,"Sunday afternoon.i ordered a double quarter burger menu. There were not more than 4-5 transactions going on. I got my ""fast food"" after 25 minute wait."
435,2,2,Don't even. The help is slow and rude and the place is filthy.   Went for breakfast and they had no eggs ready I asked for a refund and got an attitude. Just walk on by this place. They hire ex cons and by the looks of them they all should still be incarcerated. Ghetto trash for employees.
432,2,2,Filthy store.  Attitude-ridden employees.  Always out of whatever you order.  Can't get your order correct without having to repeat it about twenty times.The most enjoyable thing I've experience here was watching a cockroach and an ant race toward the wood paneling as I waited for a friend to repeat her order for the 40th time.Yeah.  Couldn't be drunk enough to try this location again.
438,2,2,"Don't go to this freaking McDonald's for food. You'll be disappointed. The food is trash and I've been eating it from here so many times in the past four years so I know. Go here if you have nothing to do in the city around 2am because I guarantee you'll meet some interesting characters. Just keep an open mind, don't go in there with too many expectations or any hang ups and get something that the servers can't mess up."
439,2,2,"#Sept 18--the lady which wasn't wearing uniform who claimed herself manager of the day.. RUDE and do not know how to respect customers..I ordered some food using coupon..guess she unhappy after I said I wanna use coupon on my order.. So she whispered ""so stupid"" and I accidentally heard it..guess I should say ""yes I am!"""
440,3,3,"On my recent trip to the east coast I just had to stop by to check outhow the east coast franchise operate? Does it taste the same as the west coast? I'm i loving it? Do you get a magical spark when consuming that high cholesterol ? Yes &no! Food is ok but great because it's open 24hrs. Taste is mediocre, quite odd flavor but I think the associates need to be more friendly, they are so dull notbeing happy to be there.Overall the venue was not Ideal And would spend my money elsewhere in town. Plus I hear the associates here beat down their clients...loving it beat down!"
441,2,2,"Bad service, rude employee ! I will never go to this Mc Donald !"
442,2,2,"I came here when it was about 95 degrees outside.  I waited in line for quite a while.  When I finally got to the register to order ice cream, I was told that there was no ice cream.  Waste of time."
443,3,3,"Wow, I can't believe I'm actually reviewing a McDonalds.We came here on NYE, hoping to grab a quick bite to tide us over before our fanciful dinner elsewhere. It was quick! They fill your drinks behind the counter, which was a little confusing at first because we've never been to one that did that.The bathroom line, however, looked like it would take forever. There was somebody in the back of the line when we came in, and by the time we were done eating, he was only about halfway closer. Yikes!Come here to eat, but if you have to pee, you'd be better off going elsewhere."
444,2,2,"Just went there and ordered a sausage mcmuffin with egg.  A ""gentleman"" before me ordered a steak and egg sandwich.  They gave him the sausage mcmuffin, which he returned but then they gave me the sausage mcmuffin he returned after they told me they did not.  In a hurry, open up the bag in my office and can tell by the way it is haphazardly wrapped, it is the ""returned"" sandwich.  Not knowing if this man bit it - I toss it. Buyer beware!!!!!!"
445,2,3,"is it possible? for years, the most reviled of the reviled, the poster child for all that's bad in the world. and yet...my friend was sick. she wanted fries. ok, i can get fries. er, do i have to actually go inside... over the years i've seen hordes of lowlife in the 3rd street franchise. the street eats there. ok i can do this. wait, there's no one in here. just me and a bunch of servers. and i'm so hungry. well, time for science experiment number 5: the state of mcD in 2007.  what looks the least harmful? the picture signs are so confusing. what language is this? this quarter pounder seems to resemble a normal hamburger. i'll try that. no stuff on it, just cheese. ok. now RUN!!!waiting for the train, starving, gotta do the quarterpounder. right here on the platform. seems fitting. here goes...DAMN THAT'S GOOD. NO, IMPOSSIBLE. YES GOOD! WAIT FOR THE AFTERTASTE...NO AFTERTASTE! WHAT IS HAPPENING? THIS IS GOOD! the world turns upside down.next day, try again at another branch. same thing. GOOD. IMPOSSIBLE. YES GOOD.my friend says, maybe it's the trans fat deal. the good oil tastes better. maybe so. have to test this new theory.let's go to another state. onward to new jersey. mcdonalds on route 80. okeedokee. here goes. quarterpounder. UGH. YUCK. SOUR. so i guess we have our public health mayor to thank for quarterpounders that taste good. only in new york city. which is just fine by me."
446,2,2,"Simply the worst McDonalds i've ever been to. Staff is rude, the place gets crowded and the food sucks."
447,2,2,"I went in for a Frappe today. The actual manager waited on me. He said that the large Frap I wanted had no coffee, ""just ice"" and presumably the ancillary whipped cream and chocolate syrup. Confused, I walked out. Later, I saw on the website that it had major caffeine. So what gives? I call customer service. Technically the man was correct! There's coffee EXTRACT, no actual coffee in the thing. I mean...really. I wanted Frap, I got rap. Why split hairs and philosophize with semantic nonsense? I'm not looking for a pure literal meaning. I just want 150+ mg of caffeine, which that provides. That man wouldn't make much of a salesman. Good thing he's in management. I'll be back, guy. Lesson learned."
448,2,2,"The most idiotic staff I have seen yet. I had a very simple order: one double cheeseburger, one fish sandwich, one order medium fries, one large coke. They managed to screw it up four times. Last time was by the manager. I swear these guys must wake up in the morning and choose the dumbest person to work the cash register."
449,2,2,This McDonald's is ok as far as the workers and food goes. But the majority of the patrons are pure trash. They are either junkies or imbeciles (or both). It makes going there a whole project. Ex) you should get your life together before you get on the line. It's McDonald's. You have been here before. Ordering should take 30 sec. max. Nobody has time  to wait on your high/dumb self to figure out what a McGriddle is. I don't go here anymore. I am sad bc it is the only McDonald's by by job but overall I am a happier person when I stay away from these types of people.
450,2,2,"I go to McDonald's to order my food and I have noticed that there was a young guy making fries with no gloves.I ask the supervisor and she told me that ""he not dealing with raw food,that why he not wearing gloves,he washing his hands every 30mins"". So I told her ""as a customer how are we supposed to know he even do that if we not standing here for 30mins?"" She started to say something and got stuck on her on words.I told her that I WILL be talking to the higher ups.So please do not order from here if they not wear mask or gloves when dealing with OUR food that we have to eat."
451,2,2,"THE WORST SERVICE EVER. If the staff spent more of their time actually attending orders instead of arguing in the back, people could actually get their food. You upgraded your physical store, start upgrading your staff."
452,2,2,Awful trashy McDonald I have never been to. I was waiting for long time and my order was wrong and they said nothing they can do about it. Very terrible experience ever.
347,2,2,"This is a terrible McDonald's experience, the kiosks weren't working correctly, the tables weren't cleaned, the chair materials are ripped and exposed, and top it off the food was old and cold, and the milkshake was warm. The facilities were clogged and disgusting, and the customer service was subpar. At least they were nice, even if they weren't helpful. I may never come here again."
453,2,2,"This McDonalds is near my home and it's always very disappointing. The last time I purchased a Happy Meal, the apple slices bag was open and as you can see in the picture, the apple was bad. It was a rainy day and I didn't feel like returning there, after all, it was not my mistake. If you are putting food in the happy meal box and you see the apple bag is open, it's common sense to toss it out and put a product that will not cause any health issue to a child's customer."
455,2,2,"This McDonald's propelled me to do a review. Smdh. 1. This McDonald's is always messy where the customers have to be, I have to clean it myself or request to have someone clean the table and seat areas.2. Everyone is Spanish that works there and many do not speak English, not sure why they were hired, other than they're Spanish. 3. When ordering it you speak English, there baby blank looks, then manager or other worker who speaks English has to translate your order to the cashier. This is frustrating to say the least, then 9 times out of 10, there's ALWAYS something wrong with your order. E.g. I ordered tea, I get everything except the tea bag. I ordered tea I get the tea with a tea bag and coffee in the cup, get the idea, I could go on... TT His is written out of frustration and now anger."
456,3,1,"I visit this McDonald's frequently since I work just a few blocks away.  It's across the street from the bus depot, on the block of the M/J/Z Marcy Avenue stop and in the middle of one of the busiest neighborhoods in N.Y.C. so this place is crowded!!!!  It's always a hot mess in the morning.  You have your fair share of vagrants and trash that hang out here.  On the outside and inside.  Me being vegetarian, I can't complain too much about this place because it's one of the few places that I can find something tasty to eat in the morning.  The fruit and yogurt parfait with granola is very satisfying.  The strawberries and blueberries in it aren't fresh.  They are frozen and most of the time they are still partially frozen when you're eating it which is annoying.  The maple oatmeal is my favorite.  Comes with real slices of granny smith apples, raisins, etc.  Their drink sizes are really wacky.  I ordered a small orange juice and this thing was at least medium sized.  The lines do move very swiftly.  They have always gotten my order correct. You can see everyone moving their butts quickly in the back to get the orders together.   It's so hard to understand most of the employees there because 99% of them have thick accents.  They aren't particularly friendly bunch here.  Oh well.  As long as they get my order correct and move it along at a fast pace, they'll continue to get my business."
457,2,2,"These people wheeled a homeless man (of their race.) into the rain. These are garbage ""humans"""
458,2,2,Crowded and slow everyday all day. I personally don't like McDonald's but my family does. It's pricey for a burger joint I would rather spend my money at shake shack.
459,3,3,"Was not fond of this location. Yes, it's a McDonalds and you shouldn't expect much but I've been to more organized locations. It's not there fault random homeless man was screaming in the middle of the ordering area. This location is also confusing because their is a back area that no one knows about. The self serve machines don't have table numbers. I'm not even sure why they have the touch screens in general. :: BATHROOM ALERT::Anyone can use the womans room or the mens room. So random people come in to use the bathroom. I watched the workers clean the bathroom twice in 30 mins. 5 stars for the clean bathroom.The vibe at this mcdonalds was just ok. But I would never come back to this spot. For some reason they had my friend waiting 20 minutes for a sweet tea. Not sure still what happened with it but it tasted unusual."
460,3,3,"If you are craving for McDonald's and you happen to be near the East Village, this is the closest. I find that their digital screen is hard to fine your all time favorite items. If you are undecided, those digital menus are not going to be helpful. With the kiosk being out of commission you literally have to rely on your memory to order food. I just come here for my once in a blue moon craving. There are no seats, and kiosks and it's just order and go."
461,3,2,"Mickey Dzzzzzz.newer-styled McDonalds location on east 14th, near the L train / 1st Avenue stop. 24 hour location, i believe. this place was super grimy for year before the update / renovation. there's a small amount of seating in the front and middle area.  this 'Donalds location has touchscreen order kiosks on the right. or you can use mobile phone ordering via the the McDonalds app. digital displays of menus at the order counter. there are restrooms for customer's past the counters. this is an average location. if you use the order kiosks or mobile app, you'll save yourself time waiting on lines as this is a high traffic location during lunch bc there are so many business in the area and during post-boozing hours bc of the concentration of bars within walking distance and the lack of cheap late night eats in the area. the main challenge of this location are homeless people and neighborhood weirdos who sometimes Inhabit this location and make it messy or ""stank."" hence why it's best to grab food to go and not dine-in. it's just an unchanging fact that plagues this location despite the staff's attempts to keep the dining area clean. it's unfortunate bc most of the people camped out here seem to have no place to go. this really is a great option when you're on the move and need a quick bite or heading home late night from the area. definitely use the app: 1) deal and 2) speeds up your order. the employees here seem to work hard and have to deal with the neighborhood's peculiar residents in stride. the food comes out fast for the most part and meets the Mickey D's fast food standards.drops mic cuz i'm fending off a Mac attacki outzzz"
462,2,2,Service was good however why do this McDonalds still offer free access to their drink machine? Saw a man walk into the McDonald's with an old cup and full his cup up so freely at the drink machine. I wouldnt advice anyone to buy a drink from this location. Very disgusting.  COVID is still out there.
463,2,2,"Just came buy too see all the employees hanging out in front saying the place is closed when posted hours on the door say they are still openWaste of space, can we fill this with a place not as useless please?"
464,2,3,I put a mobile order in for 20 piece spicy nuggets and fries Which I got correctly but got all the sauces I ordered wrong!. Should've just stuck with sticky's finger joint which is a lot closer and they can get my order right!
465,3,3,"Nothing different from any other McDonald's, except for the small fact that the deals on the app inconspicuously vanish once you're in the store. It doesn't just happen to me but also my friend who works in the area. Usually the deal will reappear once you step outside the store but on occasion, we'd have to walk a block just to get our $1 fries."
466,2,3,"So I'm here on New Year's Eve around 3:30 am. Sure, the place is going to be a mess and there's guaranteed to be a long line. I'm a reasonable person and I know I'm at mcdonalds... can't expect much. BUT... I kid you not there are PILES of vomit on the floor and outside the doors of this place. Again, I get it, it's packed they're busy but come on. Vomit on the floor? Unacceptable regardless of the time or day. I'll spare you the pictures."
467,2,2,"This place should be shit down, food is always cold and burnt, staff doesn't know how to follow instructions, don't want to do their job and bicker amongst each other!!! Ridiculous!"
468,2,2,I bring my son to this location every Monday. There are constantly junkies in the back arguing about using the bathroom and people sitting who never ordered food. The staff never do anything about it. I wish there were security guards or something to kick these people out like in other locations.
469,2,2,"The sign on the awning claims it's A 24hr location and we were refused service at 3:57am. I'm sorry, but most bars in the area aren't even closed by then. Being refused service at a supposed late night fast food joint before 4am in new york city is unacceptable. This was the first and last time I will visit this mcdonald's, taco bell is a better choice."
470,2,2,This restaurant is a homeless shelter! You see the same person or group of people loitering inside the restaurant every day. The homeless bring their plastic bags to fill them up with ice. Not to mention to use the bathrooms...gross! I guess the homeless shelter at Bellevue Hospital kicked them out.
471,2,2,"Definitely the worst of all McDonald's locations....Bums sitting in front of the store and in the store. The bums in the store are constantly bothering people for money or asking for cups. When it rains, the roof leaks right in the middle of the store. The workers are disrespectful towards each other and to customers. A couple of days ago, a customer who didn't speak English very well was trying to speak Spanish to another worker and the cashier was just complaining about how the customer didn't speak English and how she's annoying, etc. They don't pay attention to orders, I ran in last week and ordered 2 sundaes and only got charged for one and received one. When I corrected her, she had an attitude about it. The workers are constantly joking around with each other and throwing curses out at each other. I avoid this location like the plague and try to go to the one on 23rd if I can."
454,2,2,"I like to go to McDonalds because I know what I'm getting. I like to walk in and know exactly how that double quarter pounder is going to taste,  I don't like to gamble with my food. And this place was quite a gamble. Hard buns, awful service, unspeakable restroom, very disappointed."
474,2,2,Eating a burger and found a hair! Disgusting. Thanks McDonald's not eating again ever
475,2,2,"Wow when I first walked in and the homeless woman was casting a spell against me I thought, hey this may be an interesting New York story. But, when the worker screamed ""RAT"" in the back I knew that this was not your normal New York experience. I knew that this was a disgusting story. A rat scurried behind the counter while staff screamed!! I couldn't believe it! I knew that I would never eat another McDonald's again. And I also now I knew that now that $3.50 was better spent elsewhere. Never again!!!!!!!!!!!"
476,2,2,"I thought I've seen the worst McDonald's yet in Financial District when I lived down there, but there's always worse. I live in Stuyvesant Town so this is the closest one unfortunately. Let's start out by saying it's rare to visit this location and not find a couple of bum's glued to the door asking for money. Nothing get's me more hungry for some Mcnuggets then bum breathe. They have this 24/7 window which obviously they don't know how to use since they have refused orders from me before. I know this sounds crazy, but my roommate and I wanted to do a eating contest last night so we each had to eat 40 Mcnuggets, 1 McDouble, and an order of fries. Very stupid, I know now. Anyways, this place always takes long whether you had the monster order previously mentioned or just a cheeseburger. We were the only ones there and it took close to 15 minutes. Not to mention, we walked back and noticed they left out 40 Mcnuggets delaying our challenge. They never have the sauces you want, and if they do they are extremely stingy with them. Avoid this location at all costs. Unless you enjoy a nice bum fight..."
477,2,2,"It's disgusting and side and understaffed, randomly closed at odd hours. Hopefully after the renovation they'll get a security guard."
478,2,2,I don't go out of my way to review chain restaurants unless it's a polarizing expierence. Well this was one. Really unprofessional service at the registers. The folks there ( not all I hope and not Trying to generalize) really need a crash course on service. I hope they a hire a little better.
479,1,1,"I was here Sunday afternoon after a few hours of drinking.  I decided to order off the ""dollar"" menu. I ordered 2 chipotle bbq crispy chicken snack wraps.  The sauce was very tangy and not too spicy (at least for me).  The service was quick."
481,2,2,No Mcflurrys but they had shakes. Worst customer service as well- they were incredibly rude.
482,1,2,"Open 24 hours and has a walk-up window. Service can be really slow, especially late at night."
484,2,2,"Definitely a grungier McD's as evidenced by the bum who opens the door for you asking for change, and the 2 or 3 bums hanging out in the store til close. But hey, when you've gone out for happy hour and refuse to support Hot and Crusty, sometimes a snack wrap for $1.39 and 2 four piece nuggets for $1 each hits the spot. My suggestion is to go only when you have a craving and take it to go. there aren't many ""clean"" mackeys in the city, and this certainly is one of the dirtier ones."
485,2,2,Computers down for the second time in a row I've been here. As a result the lines are taking extremely long. Why can't this dump get it's act together?
486,2,2,the only good thing was the fries. my chicken was burnt and the bread that it came on was burnt. skip this place.
487,1,1,No indoor seating. Gets really crowded at lunch time. But I went around 3pm. Barely anyone. Quick service. Nice staff.
489,2,2,We have been ordering through Uber Eats due to covid.  My son will order 2-3 times a week and each time we take bets if the order is complete. Today we ordered 2 20 piece meals. We only got the 1 meal but charged for two. The prior order was 100% incorrect. Called and spoke to Manager. She said another order would have to be placed through Uber. We had to dispute to Uber and wait days for the credit. Uber driver is not able to verify food contents due to covid so can you at least have someone check quality before bags are sealed?? Prior to covid we were taking a road trip with kids. We ordered 20 cheeseburgers and 3 had no meat or cheese. Just the bun! It's a shame quality has gone down there.
490,2,2,I'm so tired of the inconsistency at this McDonald's it's bad enough most places are not open or open late ! We depend on McDonald's to be open at 5 am country wide !Workers are hungry seniors are hungry ! I'm 66 I got here at 7:20 they had not cleaned the front area or out the tables out .... I asked if they could they told me a few minutes ... I explained I'm a senior recovering from a gun shot wound I don't want to sit in the park with ants crawling over my food workers are in the park with the blowers ! They did nothing... I don't think I'll be coming back it's too stressful I'll eat at the coffee truck around the corner .. I am so disappointed
491,2,3,"Running around between appointments.  I ran in here to grab a quick snack.  Ordered an egg McMuffin to go.  The wait for this one little item was 20 minutes.  I finally got my McMuffin and starting walking to my next appointment.  I bit into the sandwich and it was hard and bitter.  The outside of the muffin looking fine.  But the inside of it was charred black.  This goes to show you, always look inside your sandwich before you eat it.  Never going back into a McDonalds again."
492,2,2,What a ridiculously lousy location.The radio was blasting commercial constantly.Zero music.
493,2,2,"I am not a morning person, but I had to be at Union Square early am and was in desperate need of breakfast. McDonald's is never my first choice, but it's usually one of the few eateries that is open by 7am (even on a Saturday).After reviewing the menu, I got to the order counter and asked whether the sausage was beef/pork/blend. The male employee had no clue. Pass! I ordered the big breakfast with hot cakes for $5.79 (scrambled eggs, hot cakes, biscuit, hash browns, minus the sausage). He corrected me and said it doesn't come with hash browns. I was confused, because I clearly see on the sign just over his left shoulder that it clearly says hash browns are included. Nonetheless, I concluded that he was either a new hire or poorly trained who needs to familiarize himself with the menu. I wasn't in the mood to argue so I opted to pay extra. I had already returned to my vehicle where I discovered not one but two hash browns. Now I totally feel like was extorted out of $1.50."
494,1,1,This woman is working the whole front by herself. She said her whole staff except 2 ppl called out tonight. Much respect to this hard working woman. Ppl were complaining about it taking so long. Yall lucky she didnt quit under pressure. Please give her a raise. And she made sure my order was correct
495,2,2,"It's bad enough that I have to review a Mc Donald's on Yelp. Overall, - oily tables - beggars asking for change as you eat - people that didn't even order were loitering throughout the restaurant - marijuana residue on my table specifically - supposedly ""no bathrooms"" - only 2 registers were open out of 5 on Thursday afternoon at 4:30 P.M."
496,2,2,Perhaps one of the shittiest MickeyDs in the area. The manager purposely shuts the phone charging units so that homeless people don't come in and charge their phones. The people who work behind the counter are usually speaking Spanish to each other even while having a customer in front of them who doesn't understand the language. It's usually very crowded too.
497,2,2,"Severely upset. I ordered two drinks and had to wait nearly 15 minutes for one and another 15 minutes for the other. The second drink was so watered down, because contrary to what one may think the two drinks were made at the same time. When I asked for a replacement due to the watered down soda they told me they don't do refills. 0/10. Poor customer service and product quality. I had come to expect more out of McDonalds but I guess I was wrong."
498,2,2,"The place is very dirty and restrooms are even nastier. Came here for breakfast with one of my friends and was told we couldn't use the restrooms because they were just cleaned and didn't want anyone dirtying them....After harassing them to use the bathroom, they finally agreed and told us that we could only use the women's restroom. The restroom was still dirty - there was soap all over the sink, walls and floor; there was also pee on the seat and on the floor..."
499,2,2,They forgot the egg in the sausage McMuffin and the breakfast wraps were cold. So were the hash browns. None of the employees care. It's really disappointing.
500,2,2,"The lady at this McDonald's we incredibly rude.  I am a regular at this location.   The lady was calling my number and I responded after 5 seconds instead of immediately.  She apparently got annoyed, gave me a dirty look, and then ridiculed me in front of the other customers next to me but mocking me insisting that my life is on that phone instead of real life.  I called McDonald's corporate to log a complaint.  I'm going to see whether they would contact the owner to rectify the situation."
501,2,2,Haiku:Swore I'd stop goingI eat away my sorrowsDon't f*cking go hereTo Eat or Not to Eat? Quoth the raven nevermore!
502,2,3,Poor customer service and safety. Staff totally rude (some don't even communicate in English). Homeless roaming around panhandling. Patrons  texting and occuping seats after eating...thereby limiting seating capacity  to those attempting to have their respective meals. No one cares cause everyone is SPECIAL!
503,1,1,Wonderful Experience! I sat here for a few hours! They have free WiFi. 24 Hours!! A single bathroom! I lost my iPad and the manger found it!!!I like the music selection. It actually was a pretty good McDonalds Experience!
504,2,3,"I'm a 53 year old professional woman, who have frequented this location for the last 3 years, 1-3 times a week, sometimes even more. I go here for lunch, bring my book, go downstairs to eat and read. I normally spend about 45-50 minutes here. I know the location have a 30 minute limit, but I would assume that would apply when the restaurant is full, or for those who sit there for hours working, are loud and disturbing others, just hanging out or whatever they are doing. When I have to take lunch late, I have suffered through the downstairs area being completely filled with loud and obnoxious school kids who yell and play music and whatnot. Nothing is ever said to them, whether they eat or not, no matter how long they are there.I have been approached by panhandlers approaching me while I eat more often than not. And the panhandlers are opening the door for me regularly, expecting a handout for their service. Tell THEM to leave.Today when I had sat there for 40 minutes and was about to finish my drink and return to work, I was approached by a new security guard who basically told me I had been there for too long. I was sitting downstairs where there was plenty free seats, and again, I would think this rule would be applied and used together with common sense. I was not the only one surprised and who was shaking my head as I left.I told the manager on site what happened, that I am never coming back, and left.Sorry McDonalds, you have lost a regular customer as I don't like being treated like this. Maybe I am just sensitive but this was ridiculous and embarrassing and I'm too old for that kind of BS."
505,2,2,"They don't speak to each other in English and make derogatory comments about customers. Disorganized. Slow. A disgrace. No automated terminals and homeless ""doormen"" are stationed at the entrance. I ordered, among other thungs, a medium ciffe6, but was served a small."
506,2,3,"Long lines, long waits.  Slightly less busted atmosphere than other locations in town.  They're my go-to out of necessity when grabbing quick food before a movie at one of the nearby theaters.  Otherwise, steer clear."
507,2,2,"This is for the Broadway on between Washington and Wavery,  Since you don't have this as a location - you're getting this review.Every time I come here, there's a long line which you have to funnel through two rows of chairs and tables.  WHY?  Such a poor design.  Then you wait and wait as there's 5 or so registers but maybe at most 2 workers manning those stations.  Then you'll have the manager or whoever is actually working, say ""THERE'S TWO LINES!""  but you never direct anyone to them.  Why don't you get the line dividers like EVERY other fast food place that has these lines?  EVEN BANKS use them!!!  Instead of shouting it out in a jumbled mess that you must have learned by hearing the MTA PA system.  You only confuse people and then create chaos with everyone trying to rush to this new so called line you wanted people on but didn't direct to.Sure it may sound easy on paper saying there's two lines.  But when the workers there don't respond to anything and won't tell what is the new second line, it doesn't do anything.You wanted a higher minimum wage?! LOLOLOL try offering good value service.  What makes you think you deserve such a high wage with this kind of service?"
508,1,1,This McDonald's is clean and has two floors. It gets quite busy there with a lot of customers. Sometimes you can' t find seating because there are a lot of customers. I go there for a frappe or smoothie then go sit in the park.
509,2,2,"It's pouring and I don't want to walk far. I order my meal which is three things...from the dollar menu. First of all people don't know how to respect others on line, there's no order and it's chaotic. I place my order at 3:39, had at least 9 people after me and  more then half got their food first. I didn't fight or say anything surprisingly but was just thinking THESE are the deserving people of New York who need $15 an hour YEAH RIGHT. I didn't get my food until 3:55, they ""forgot"" about my order along with the order of the kid who ordered after me. Also it's just extremely noisy with a million teens, go read a book or something. Should of just given me a free apple pie and I wouldn't be writing this lovely review."
511,1,1,"I feel ridiculous reviewing a McDonald's, and even more so giving it four stars, but this is a GREAT McDonald's (only relative to other McDonald's of course)!Maybe it's because it's located in Manhattan, but customer service here is so much better than what you would find in Brooklyn. I don't eat McDonald's much, but when there are cute toys, how can I resist buying a Happy Meal for their sake? I started coming to this location after a friend told me that they will let you change toys (I'm really serious about collecting them). They've definitely gone out of their way to get me the toy I want.There was a time I asked them for orange juice, but later, was told that the machine was broken. The manager actually came over to apologize to me, explain the situation, and then offered possible substitutions. This McDonald's is decently big, but the bathrooms are surprisingly very small. There were only two stalls, and it was awkward forming a line, because with the space left, only two people will fit at a time. Still, it was cleaner than I would have expected.I'm a bit surprised by the bad reviews, but maybe it depends on when you go? I usually go late in the afternoon, and once at 9 pm. It looks difficult to get a seat in the afternoon, but I almost never eat at the location, so it doesn't really affect me."
512,1,1,"One of the better ones.Lines are always long but move very quickly.  Definitely one of the better locations to get a perfectly mixed cup of iced coffee.  Cashiers actually listen and walk the order to the sole barista in the back to ensure that it's made exactly as ordered.  I have my favorites here and try to jump on their lines but the newbies are normally sweet as pie.  I especially like that even though they're in the city and recently remodeled (fair justification to raise their prices) they honor coupons and promotions like $1 any sized hot coffee - Dunkin' typically doesn't do that.  Short lines, soft cookies, kick ass coffee, free wifi and clean facility - can't get any better than this in Union Square."
513,1,3,"I came here at late night. Just the right amount of people, neither packed full nor deserted. It sure must be busier during the day, though. I found the place clean and comfortable, and of course loved the feee wi-fi."
514,2,2,"Terrible experience. I would give zero if I could. Card machine stopped working so I used cash. Cashier gave me the wrong change (minor difference) but I asked her politely thinking to get an accurate change in principle. She insulted me in front of other customers by ridiculing me for asking for small change, giving me double amount of what she missed, and rushing me away with sarcasm. This should NEVER happen in professional business transaction. Enough said."
515,3,3,"Visited again today for iced coffee. That is the only thing I go to McDonalds for. The line for the registers is very irregular. It was busy but some lines were long and some were short. But people that came in after me, who picked a quicker shorter line were served before me.I am still having trouble finding a McDonalds that can make the coffee I order correctly. I don't think its difficult, I order coffee with whole milk. Why does the register person ask me 5 times if I want half and half and sugar five times. Are they such poor listeners. What gets me is today they asked so many times about the milk and sugar and they still proceeded to prepare it wrong.I strongly recommend McDonalds change the way they prepare coffee because the current method is too confusing for their employees."
516,3,3,It's close to my work and the service is quick! They are friendly and keep the dining room clean. This location does get extremely busy at times and homeless people hangout in the lobby frequently. It doesn't bother me much though.They have free WIFI and bathrooms to use if you're a paying customer.
517,2,2,"The big lady that's cleans and also does the cashier at midnight yelled at me ""what choo want""? As if she talks to a dog. It looks like all the basic hospitality norms have gone out the window. Time for young fresh people to make the world a better place. The problem for her and the franchisee is that this complaint is going to corporate offices so that no one else is treated like this in the future!"
518,1,2,"4 Stars for McDonald's?!? Before you try to get Sam to revoke my Yelp Elite status, allow me to explain. There is only one item in McDonald's that I allow myself to consume. Er, to consume on a regular basis (I did have 2 Minty Mudbath Shakes that tasted like regular chocolate shakes a couple of weeks ago. Oh, and I had a Sausage Egg McMuffin last week when I was running late and nearly delirious from hunger. Shit, actually...ahhh, nevermind).The point I'm trying to make here is that the McD Fruit and Yogurt Parfait is pretty darn good. Vanilla yogurt, unfrozen strawberries and blueberries, topped with crunchy granola. For 99 cents. Anyone who has bought yogurt in a supermarket in NYC should know what a deal this is.  I have been eating two of them for lunch three times a week for a couple of months now and, KAPOW! I'm almost ready to flash my abs at the next Elite event. (You guys may want to petition Sam to take away my Elite status for that last statement).Anyway, for those who stroll into McD's because of the power of my persuasive Yelp review all intent on ordering a Yogurt parfait but then smell the fries and feel the temptation to order something else, please feast your eyes on the following calorie and fat numbers culled from McD's own website:Quarter Pounder with Cheese:  510 Calories, 230 from FATGRILLED Chicken Club: 570 Calories, 190 from FATLarge Fries:  570 Calories, 270 from FATSouthwest SALAD w/ Chicken (it's a fucking 400 calorie SALAD!!)And drumroll please.......Fruit and Yogurt Parfait:  160 Calories, 20 Calories from fat."
519,2,2,"Being the alert, media vulture that I am, I immediately ceased my patronage of McDonalds following the release of the shocking documentary ""Supersize Me"".  As a child, I was unwittingly suckered into the sexy, high cholesterol world of Ronald McDonald.  Would a clown ever endanger the health of a young, impressionable child?  Well, in the case of John Wayne Gacy, yes.  But not a respectable member of the clown community like Ronald McDonald.  Ronald represented a dream for millions of American children; that at the end of a grueling week, the school clothes come off, the red wig, yellow jumper and face paint go on, and the guiltless indulgence of massive quantities of LDL cholesterol could commense.  Of course, I didn't really need a groundbreaking documentary to ameliorate me in making a correlation between my girth and my love of Big Macs.  
 Still, despite having sworn off the Golden Arches, I found myself back there last Friday.  My girlfriend wasn't feeling well, and I thought ""What better food to give someone who is suffering ill health effects than McDonalds?""  I'm just thoughtful in that sense.  
 Upon entering the Grand Temple of Coronary Distress, I noticed an advertisement for something called the Arch Card.  Essentially, McDonalds has begun vendoring gift cards to its patrons, just in time for the holiday season.  And believe you me, there is no more endearing gift to bestow upon your loved ones during the holiday season than the gift of certain death by way of fast food.  As a child, no such grandiose gift was made available to me.  I cannot count the times I awoke on Christmas morning, budding with youthful vigor, only to attack my stash under the artificial tree and find nothing but toys and underwear.  No hamburgers.  Thanks mom and dad.
 Well, I guess this turned out to be less a review than a criticsm.  We do live in New York , so I would I advise you to undertake any number of alternate, culinary endeavors that our city has to offer.  Reject the clown."
520,1,1,"I had 2 little boys with me the other day when we were sent to McDonalds for dinner.  A 2 year old in a stroller, and a 6 year old with a scooter and helmet.  Being a ground floor entrance, it was nice and easy getting the stroller inside, and plenty of places on the main level to pull up next to.  I also noticed a huge downstairs eating area for those who can do stairs easily.  The staff was so helpful and basically picked a spot for us to sit, helped the 6 year old safely stash his scooter while I got the baby out of the stroller and dealt with the food.Ordering wasn't too bad - it was dinner time and kind of a madhouse in there, but the lines moved quickly and were fairly organized.  The little 6 year old accidentally spilled his smoothie opening his happy meal toy, basically about 3 sips in.  As he sat there stunned looking up to me for guidance the team of McDonalds angels swooped in once again with napkins.  We all helped clean up the mess, and the employees were so kind without a hint of annoyance on their faces.  By the time we were finished, one of them had already brought back a brand new smoothie.  Super helpful.The one thing I wish they had was kid-sized icecreams.  I had to tell them to make them extra small because if you give a kid an icecream cone and tell them not to eat it all, its just not gonna happen.  It was a good experience, and not a place I'd bring kids everyday - but when you are in a pinch know that this location and its employees have your back."
521,1,2,"It pains me to type this review. I never thought I'd like a McDonald's. Let alone give one 4 stars. And McDonald's in San Francisco is just not as plentiful or easily accessible. Probably because SF has a little more common sense when it comes to this sort of thing. But I digress ...I was heading to Mister Softee (or Senor Suave as they refer to him in the Bronx) and I decided what I wanted. And I stood at the window. I saw the guy who was supposed to be serving it up. What was he doing? Playing on his sidekick. Hello? You get paid to do this? Is this an hourly job? I hope not. Because nobody should be paying you since you want to play on your sidekick all day. Enter McDonald's. 20 feet away. And perfectly capable of providing me with a soft serve fix for less than MS.I head in. Wait for a second and notice the mad scrambling of at least 10 employees behind the counter alone. Wow the service must be good here. I decide to upgrade my soft serve cone to a meal. ""Hi, I'll have 1 large fry, 2 apple pies, and a soft serve cone."" (don't judge me)""That'll be 4.39 ma'am""For some reason I was expecting to pay more. But the fries at this McDonald's are cheaper than most in Manhattan. No joke. I watched my cashier enter the rush of employees in the back to get my order. She almost forgot my cone. But then she didn't. And piled on extra. And it tasted better than Mister Softee. And I left very satisfied indeed. And I still can't believe I'm giving a McDonald's in the city 4 stars but if you must go to one, go to this one.PS It's open 24 hours."

523,1,2,"How has this McDonald's been an oasis on my trips to New York?1) Bathroom so available that McDonald's in NYC is almost a public space.2) Dollar Menu (cookies, etc.) and/or improved Coffee...nourishment when necessary, and chance to crash and read when a time kill is needed.3) Cheap dinner/ time kill when taking kids to Slava's Snowshow. People watching did the trick, but 13 yr. old insisted on her schlepping to Starbucks too4) 99 cent surcharge ATM to get cashEdit- my daughter said to point out most of the US does not have the delicious McDonald's veggie burger like this one does- another advantage to NYC Mickie-D's."
524,2,2,"Yup, I'm reviewing McDonald's now. The main thing to know about this location is that the prices are slightly higher (like $1.30 for dollar menu items instead of $1) and they don't participate as much in the national promos (i.e. when it's 2 filet-o-fish for $3, here it will be $4).   (The McDs on 6th avenue nr 16th street I believe is better at having similar promos to nationwide).I realize there's no point in reviewing fast food joints since, who the heck reads a review for McDonald's before going there?!?  :)"
525,2,2,Lots of young kids in here not eating just yelling and screaming and causing problems
526,2,2,"Normally I wouldn't bother reviewing a McDonalds.  Most people know what they're going to get when then go.  However, when I heard that they were going to have Shamrock Shakes, I figured I knew what I was getting.  But unlike most of the times where it's a known entity, this time it wasn't.They ran out.  Or their machine broke.  Or some other excuse.  I don't care what the actual problem was, poor management happened.  There aren't many chances that McDonalds gets to excite people, and they blew the one they had."
527,2,2,Waited 15 min for my fish fillet. Asked the lady over the counter and got an uber rude response sayin 'I asked if anyone order fish fillet'. Like yeh bitch u asked? We're u talking to urself. Managers here need to step it up.
528,2,2,Very slow and not well trained.  Extremely disappointed at how disorganized then are once a line builds.  Same person filling coffee orders got out orders that were placed after me.   Corporate should really review
529,2,2,"Honestly..Its one of the cleaner McDonald's in the city...But I was extremely disappointed to find out they are not honoring the $1any sized iced coffee deal they are advertising on TV. I thought McDonald's was trying to push its value items? Did they NOT just do a menu overhaul to cut prices? Even with a lower price, NYC McDonald's would generate more revenue... Especially a location in a highly trafficed area like Union Square. This is just bad business and false advertisement. Very inconsistent, McDonald's!"
473,1,1,"Tonight, I got an Egg McMuffin because I could and because the L train was down. And when I took pics of it, the crackhead lady in front of me thought I was taking photos of her. Then I went outside and a homeless dude threw up next to me. And I saw a clueless girl trying to cross the street and unaware that she was about to be run over by an ambulance with its siren on. She was staring at her phone. To top it off, I saw a bro riding one of those faux ""hoverboards."" #AllDayBreakfast"
531,3,3,"This is one of my favorite McD's (if such a thing makes sense..) They get a large lunch crowd so the quick turn around guarantees you will get a ""fresh"" meal out the door. Let's use the term ""fresh"" lightly since after all you're eating at McD's and you should have the brain to know what you're REALLY getting. Prices are typically inflated compared to locations in the outer boroughs, but hey we're in Manhattan! It totally sucks seeing the commercials brag about their 2 for $2 fish filet or $5 - 20 pc. nugget deals because HAHA they don't apply to those locations in the city. You should really stop eating this stuff.. but if you must and can deal with the occasional pan handlers holding the doors for you out front and the herds of obnoxious teenagers from neighboring schools then come on by and get a ""fresh"" batch of fries."
532,1,1,"This is just a review of the oatmeal they serve at McDonald's. It's actually very tasty. Much better than the oatmeal at starbucks. They add a little milk and then hot water. Then they add the fruit for you, stir it and all you have to do is pay for it and eat. The fruit is kinda fresh too. Starbucks on the other hand, gives you that packet of dried fruit. Not that it's bad, but fresher is better. The last time I went to starbucks for oatmeal, the guy had to make it over 3 times. First time, the water wasn't hot. It was barely warm. Then, twice he put way too much water in the cup. I'm not splitting hairs. A little too much water can be absorbed, but he filled the cup up to the very top with water...TWICE. I had to stand there on the 4th try and tell him when to stop with the water. You would think they were trained in the intricate art of oatmeal preparation but obviously not."
537,1,1,"This is a phenomenal McDonald's. I come here after a run sometimes and they are fast and the food is always hot. Most importantly, I have always gotten the sauces I ask for at this establishment. Much love to all who work here. Thank you. This is a great McDonald's, you will get the same thing as at all other good McDonald. Cheers."
538,3,3,"This McDonald's has been updated and has the touch screens for ordering.  It's relatively clean and the food is well prepared but they need to put a code on the door to keep people from using the restrooms for illicit purposes.The night I was there, two guys tied up the men's room for about 20 minutes between them.  When one of them came out, I went to wash my hands and thought I was on the set of ""Pineapple Express""!  And the dude only came out after my burly friend banged on the door.  Once I left, he immediately went back in.  When he left, another sketchy guy shuffled in and was still in there when we left.  I don't think he was smoking weed, though.   And I don't care if someone wants to light up, but do it somewhere that doesn't interfere with me using the men's room!  I felt bad for the women's room because men were using that since they couldn't get into the men's room.  Sorry about the wet seat, ladies!I've heard about the issues with the McDonald's near Penn Station and the rampant drug use that goes on there so the management team here should do something to ensure that this McD's doesn't get the same reputation."
539,2,2,i have been deleting bad reviews that i have made from the past but this one is hard not to. I am just looking through the pictures and I can't Someone can get sick. believe that McDonald's would let one of their stores to serve moldy and old burgers. I can't believe that even touched my lips. This is just disgusting.
540,2,2,Don't know how many people this location is ripping off on the soft drink but what they are doing is placing a smaller cup inside the larger cup and then handing you the drink filled at the counter. It looks like you are getting the medium drink but you're actually only getting a small cup with about 25% less drink. Shame on this location. Stop ripping people off!!
541,3,3,"This McDonald's has been renovated since the last time I was here a few years ago. It does look better, however, the bathroom doors don't close properly & they're not the cleanest. It's a warm fall day (70 degrees)  and the heat is on! You can see the employees are hot & not happy. They aren't rude but they aren't giving ""service with a smile"". The temperature inside is uncomfortable for me so I can only imagine how it feels for them! The food did taste fresh (as fresh as fast food can get) but it took almost 15 minutes to get my order! Well over the time it should have taken. The only reason they got 3 stars instead of 2 was because the food was freshly made"
542,3,3,Yes this is the slowest McDonald's in the area however the only one in my area. Sometimes they get things done at an average rate. The service needs a little work but totally understand the stress  they have trying to improve their  turnaround time.
543,2,2,"The slowest drive through with no customers at 1.44am.  More workers than customers.  The most dismal service ever.  The entire store needs to be retrained. Fast food not. Drive through in Uber? Tip them very well, you will be waiting for a long long time."
544,2,2,This place is the worst. They have a broken ice cream machine that has been broken for many months. This is terrible. Please fix this!
545,2,2,"sooooo...here we go AGAIN...I stopped at McDonalds(840 Atlantic Ave BKLYN) at exactly 10:55 am...the young lady who took my order was polite...the cramp face plus size sister that handed me my order scared me with these extremely long stiletto fingernails(white with alot of color) she could barely pick up the coins from the register with these bird claws...I asked for chocolate chip cookies warm..instead I got yesterdays I didnt sell, we gonna get rid of them today cookies..ughhhh..."
547,2,2,"this place is fucking trash! they have fucked up every order i have gotten from there.how do you fuck up the big mac?!?!?! i mean its the signature sandwich... on top of that both fries were cold and bland. my nuggets were stale and soggy in some spots. my large sprite was seltzer. no napkins, no nugget sauce, they completely forgot my hotcakes! i guess i paid ~$40 for mcdonalds to deliver me a big bag of ""fuck you, but thanks for your money""!worst part about it is, uber eats' limits the locations i can order from and i cant get in contact with them to let them know just how shitty this place is! cold food, shitty customer service and just f.u.b.a.r.!! do not order from here!!!"
548,2,2,Terrible service the workers are rude and irresponsible.They just too relaxing about work here
549,3,2,"Well, I stopped by when the line took forever... at least six people working, one the drive-thru and one cleaning up front, three workers in the back and one at the cash register... and a long long line.Bright side is that as I ordered breakfast, the lady made it right in front of me and had it done before I was ready to pay. Can't say everyone else was that speedy... but mine was."
550,2,2,"Hands down this is the slowest dive thru I've ever experienced. Don't even attempt to go through the drive thru here. I am currently in a car waiting for my food. It's been THIRTY MINUTES and counting! I've already paid and I'm starving so I'm stuck in this line. What is happening!? If you're reading this save yourself and go somewhere else. If you're already in line 1) please check that my starved body isn't passed out against the wall and 2) get off the line and run away as fast as you can. Seriously, don't fool yourself into thinking it's just an anomaly and your line will start moving soon. It won't. At this rate I could've built my own McDonald's, ordered and served myself."
551,2,2,"If I could give this location negative stars, I absolutely would. We have waited 30-45+ for our food on multiple occasions while going through the drive through and they always forget something (straws, ketchup, etc) or our order is incorrect. Worst McDonald's I have ever been in my life! Stay away!"
552,2,2,"I go to this McDonald's on occasion since they have parking. This location has recently been renovated but the service still is not great and the order wait times have not improved. Also, make sure to check your order! When I got home and checked my large french fry box, it was half full. I paid for a full box. Oh well... just beware."
554,3,3,"They've just reopened after renovating with touch screen menus and table service. Since they've JUST opened again recently, the staff a still attentive. Got a couple of cheeseburgers from the dollar menu, somehow it felt like it was sitting out under a heating lamp all day. I give them about 1.5 - 2 weeks before the staff goes back to their ratchet selves."
555,2,1,"Slowest drive thru validated for the 1,000th time. Asked us to ""please pull forward"" and we watched four drivers behind us pass us by. Not a complex order either. Somewhat in a rush (HA - shoulda checked their yelp and read reviews), I walked in asking where my food was and a woman holding my bag was very reluctant to give me my food and didn't hold back any sass while doing it. EW. Just do your job, hunty. And if you're gonna ask us two different times about sauce, you better put in some MF sauce!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get yo act together!!!!! The people are hungry!!!!!! Ugh."
556,2,2,Slowest  drive through ever 25 minutes on a Friday night. Ridiculous   can I say Ridiculous  again.Never experienced this at a McDonald's before.  Management  needs to look at this.The fries were barely warm not hot and the fish sandwich was overcooked.Couldn't go back .I was there from 10:05 -10:30. Won't  go there again. Will nor waste $8.71 of my hard earned money for mediocre food.Gave one star so  I could post this review
557,2,3,"We were driving past, in need of quick caffeine, so we decided on this McDonald's drive-thru to pick up two coffees. It literally took 15 minutes for us to get 2 coffees with milk. No sugar, no flavors, nothing complicated. But still it took 15 mins! Maybe we would have had better luck walking in."
558,2,2,Horribles customer service. I'd expect the drive thru line to go way faster if there's 10 cars in line 1 star does not cut it should be 0 stars
559,2,2,"The girl at the drive thru gave me misinformation. I asked how much are the apple pies, she stated $1. When she wrung me up, it was $1.39. I asked her why did she say it was a dollar and she stated, ""oh we just say that"".. I told her she shouldnt be saying that if thats not what it is, i dont think she liked that.. She stated ""it's only a few cents difference.. Do you want a refund?"" I used my debit, it takes at least a day to get the money back.. I said no, that takes too long, just forget it.. I felt cheated. Tried calling the next day to speak to a manager and they dont answer the phone.."
560,2,3,"two words: rat infested.and if you want to make some easy money, they never shovel in the winter."
561,2,2,So terrible. We had to ask to place our order and the cashier wouldn't look at us and clearly hated her life. I wish I could give it no starts.
562,2,3,"Waited in line for 30 mins then my food was cold, the crew caught an attitude and snatched it back."
563,2,2,"After about a 13min wait in the drive-thru (this is after there big renovation) I can't even place my order in full because they don't have any Hi-Ci orange. Ok so i got more hungry during the wait and decided to add something to my order. I cannot add to my order I must drive around! Oh really ok, So take -3stars for that. Wasting my time and not satisfying me the ""customer""!"
564,2,3,The only reason you might go to a McDonalds is for FAST food. This is the slowest place on earth. The best thing about it is if there is traffic on Vanderbilt you can cut through their parking lot.
565,2,2,This place don't even make mcflurries doe. How am I supposed to cop that Icecream if they ain't even tryna make it for me? 1 star. Very bad
566,2,2,"This is the slowest fast food restaurant ever. Cannot believe how long it takes to get microwaved ""food"". Will never come here again. Worst service that one could imagine.  Bad, bad, bad!!"
567,1,1,"I really liked how clean the restaurant was, I found it to have a nice set up of chairs and it was super cute . The staff was very friendly and the food was good. First time I try the pico guac sandwich and it was yummy!"
568,2,2,"I am not sure how this place usually runs, but today was the most disappointing service I've had at any McDonald's. 1st I noticed there was a guy standing with an ipad taking orders as opposed to folks going to the speaker. I ask was the speaker in service he says yes, but I gave him my order anyway. He repeated the order back to me wrong, twice. He finally got it right.... WRONG! My order ended up being a mess. The bag itself had a giant rip in it!  When I ask the young lady about the bag, she just said oh yeah that's all they gave it to me, smiled while chatting with coworkers and shut the window. I look in the bag to inspect whether my food was correct I had been given some barbecue sauce for nuggets. No one asked what kind of sauce I needed. So, why are you assuming I want barbecue? I actually wanted honey mustard! Fish no cheese, came with cheese on it sliding down the side of the bun (luckily the sauce was on the side). I gave up and left.This was a convenient stop but I will never again make the mistake of coming here."

The restaurant sits across from a Mobil gas station on a small wedge bounded by Centre Street, Smith Street, Bush Street, and Hamilton Avenue. It's a noisy, industrial place, equidistant from a concrete supplier and Other Half Brewing Company, right by the Gowanus Canal. Chances are, you ended up here either because you live nearby or you got desperate while driving past.Last night, I was craving a second dinner, and, seeing a GrubHub perk for no fees, I caved and ordered McDonald's delivery. Unfortunately, my delivery person took my food on a roundabout route, perhaps to drop off another order, with the end result being that my food was cold by the time it arrived. While I can hardly fault the restaurant for that, it certainly didn't impress me.I ordered a Big Mac, seeking the thrill and relief I see in the commercials when people eat this burger. It ended up being pretty blase. The chopped lettuce was not fresh and the burger patties were dry, almost crumbly. The American cheese and secret sauce provided tangy lubrication but were insufficient to save the sandwich.My nugs were okay, though I would've preferred the spicy version; not sure why those weren't available online. The french fries, unfortunately, were quite awful. I gave them 30 seconds in the microwave, but that didn't help. With disappointment in my heart, I complained to GrubHub, and they refunded me for my order. Now if only I could get back my time and calories. Time to guilt-lift at the gym and put this whole business behind me."

We dropped them off at Ikea and drove to the McDonald nearby (saw the golden arches) and wanted something quick. This place does not have Filet Fish (or ran out?), the lady at the register said ""no fish"" when I tried ordering it. I had looked for it at the menu but didn't see it so I just said Filet Fish instead of the Combo number (used to be #9). I ended up getting a large fry, large coke and 4 pc chicken nugget with bbq sauce. Ate it in the car in the Ikea parking lot."
571,2,2,They never manage to get all the items you've ordered into your bag. Today they left off a 10 piece chicken nuggets. This happens 50% of the time I go here.
572,1,3,Food is always hot and fries are always fresh! I woulda gave them 5 stars but when you tell them X amount of cream and X amount of sugar they NEVER put it smh anyways food still good
573,2,2,"The Spanish American is a racist. Near me was a white woman. The staff was talking with her. Even if I was there, nobody said ""Hello"" or ""Hi"" When I spoke to the Spanish American manager, ""Hello,"" ""Excuse me"" loudly several times, But she didn't look at me and answer. I felt that I wasn't there. I know that American Asians are like some insects because of COVID-19 this year in America. But It was too much! The manager did do racism too much!"
574,3,3,I went through again today and things was better  they didnlt mess up my order. this place needs to stay open cuz a lotta people need food and it aint easy to get any otherb place and this plave got a druve thru so is conveninet
575,1,1,Okay I've been going to this McDonald's for years and I don't know what they did but I went there this morning for a McDonald's biscuit sandwich and it was the best biscuit sandwich I've ever had for McDonald's ever they got a new screen board now I can hear what the lady is saying and they even have a new friendly sign that says thank you for coming keep it up McDonald's maybe you'll get me coming in for breakfast tomorrow LOL
577,1,1,The drive thru service is great. For some reason this place has the freshest mcnuggets out of all the McDonald's I have been to. They are crispy and hot every time.
576,2,2,Worst service ever these people sound like there don't even want to serve you . Who ever hired there Saturday 12am staff should be fired . Pathetic McDonald's front office should be ashamed! Never again ..
578,3,3,"I have eaten here many times.  The place is always reasonably clean.  The food and service are what you would normally expect in a McDonald's - however keep your hand on your wallet and your phone in your pocket if you're inside the restaurant.  As others have reported this location is a big hangout for druggies and the management never seems to do anything about it.  I'm 6' tall and 200+ lbs. ex-moving man, so I'm not scared for myself - but even so, I would not bring my wife and son to this location for a meal."
579,3,3,Went their on a Sunday morning around 9:35 with only one other customer and it's now 9:45 and I'm still waiting for  my order. Nice staff but slow at getting food ready.
580,2,2,Every time I come here they take forever at the drive through and process your order. I don't understand how you guys want $15 an hour and their service is getting worse
582,2,2,Have worked at McDonalds and this one is the worst. Takes FOR-E-VER!!!!!!  The drive-they is never less than a 20 min wait.
583,2,2,Where is the damned playland you f'ers?!!!!!!! you really expect me to eat fries anywhere else?
584,1,1,Best place to observe Methadonian eating habits!  Seat yourself in a safe location but have your cell phone ready for emergency calls just in case.  Enjoy the show!
530,2,2,"I'm no elitist, but this McDonald's is hella ghetto.  Whether it's the people behind the register that stare at you like a pack of bulldogs or the downstairs dining area that I affectionitely refer to as ""the dungeon,"" this is probably the most depressing spot in Union Square.  Unlike it's next-door 24-hour partner, Starbucks, people come into this McDonald's tired and filthy, and leave greasier than they came in.  I'm not saying I haven't eaten here--I love Chicken McNuggets, soft serve cones, and McDonald's heartattack of a breakfast, plus their 32oz ice coffee would cost you around $18 at Starbucks.  But if you plan to eat here, chances are it's gonna stink.  Literally.  I give this McDonald's two stars instead of one, based for the fact that it's open 24/7."
437,3,3,"The employees are fast and friendly, so that's a plus. My biggest issue with the food though is that my English muffins are ALWAYS burnt. I think this is a timing issue. Also, I've noticed at lunch and dinner time, if the place isn't packed, there's a good chance my food will come out luke warm.In terms of overall environment inside the restaurant, I think it's probably a 5 or 6 out of 10 in terms of cleanliness -- but I usually get my food to go, so I can't comment too much on the dine-in experience.In terms of overall environment *outside* the restaurant, I agree with some other yelpers about not always feeling entirely comfortable. There have been instances when homeless men have parked themselves right in next to the entrance to ask for money. It can be awkward go past them, especially if you don't have cash on hand. At times, I've just not gone inside.So, in sum, muffins need to be cooked properly, cleanliness could improve a bit, all food could be MUCH hotter, and some light security (or even a diligent, husky manager or two) could make the place more comfortable."
309,2,2,"I recently went to the McDonald's on 395 Flatbush Avenue,I saw people waiting for a very long time,my order was placed via mobile at 1124 pm put it this way I walked out of the McDonald's at 1215 am without my food,the manager sherry has no idea how to manage when things get busy,very unprofessional and falls under the pressure.this will be the last time for me going to this McDonald's I thought Ronald McDonald was the only clown  looks like you have a bunch of clowns working in this establishment I repeat don't ever come to this McDonald's"
