We n't like shout one another simple conversation . It 's also way dim . I almost could n't read menu , seriously need edit . Cut 150 item 100 well.Our waiter , service slow , polite answered question Blood Orange Martini . The drink $ 12 $ 14 ... get drink glass . You serve shaker another drink half , like get Applebee 's price . So I laugh get anything soda . But never get water . Do bring automatically ? Were suppose ask ? We decide try truffle bacon cheese stick . Basically , 's grilled cheese bacon cut four strip . I could n't tell cheese flavor . The bacon part flavor , though toast nicely . The tomato dip sauce taste like straight tomato paste . Not even cook tomato paste . And unseasoned . Tasted like come directly nothing . Some restaurant n't understand tomato paste need cook get rid paste flavor .

They also much good rice.The table next us , seat , alcoholic beverage AND water us , bring entree , btw , I hope n't upset that.A serious suggestion restaurant : Make miniature version dessert offer `` Flight `` 3 5 flavor , customer taste several dessert . I seriously count 17 different dessert I want try . If I could get flight five husband could get flight five , 's ten desserts could share try.We settle Lemon Meringue Cheesecake .

366,2,2,"I 've several Cheesecake Factory restaurant ; one , long shot , bad . I go around 18 month ago three acquaintance , include limited : mom , grandmother , brother . After get laptop school , think would great get bite eat The Cheesecake Factory . We seat relatively quickly since din slow hour . Dining evening would entirely different story . You would probably squeeze people get seat get Barbie local Target Black Friday sale . In word , would wait eternity get seat since many people eat place . The scenery similar branch I eat - relatively romantic , dark ambiance cool napkin . Overall , good eating environment , nothing change way I perceive reality . Our server , male I n't remember name , kind attentive . That say , I complaint there.However , important part - food - total disaster . My mother grandmother order salad ahi tuna ; I order pot sticker ; brother , I forget order . All three dish BEYOND DISAPPOINTING ! The two order salad three piece tuna . THREE PIECES ... WHAT THE HELL ! ? To charge $ 18 salad , put enough tuna barely satisfy starving child India , outrageous . Are chef ration freak tuna ? Yeah , let put 1 ounce fish salad ... great idea lol ! Jokes aside , mockery salad - `` bad I ever , `` say poor grandmother sorrow depression . My potstickers horse dung well . They entirely salty I could taste neither content filling wrapping dumpling ( I 'm sure 's culinary name I clue 's call ) . I n't know type glaze put , clearly overwhelming proportion soy sauce I taste salt . I would potstickers plain , however Cheesecake Factory think would good idea dump half cup glaze pot sticker side separate dish , like restaurant . I disgust first bite , force drink like college student Coachella wash away taste mouth , hydrate bite like gulp salt water . I feel genuinely awful waiter , ask us food , bombard complaint . My grandmother go trash salad , rightfully call manager give piece mind , . My mom also complain . I choose refrain complain pot sticker I certain poor manager would break cry hear I say . The guy probably war flashback keep night strong , independent grandmother tell . Despite know order , I recall fond food well.We n't bother order desert want get hell establishment soon humanely possible . Plus , runner , cheesecake would go straight thigh gluteus , mention damage would cause artery . As plus , manager take salad check , kind . If I complain , I imagine would take pot sticker , would make bill less $ 20 consider brother order . A respectable gesture , , fair , upscale place like Cheesecake Factory mess salad - something difficult . I culinary skill prepare mean salad would receive praise dear friend Barack . We pay bill provide 20 % gratuity kind waiter.As whole , experience abominable . I sure place excel desert specialty item menu . However , excuse subpar item order . Perhaps come day ? Even , well-known chain need consistent quality cuisine . I nearly forget point everything order overprice . You n't charge $ 18 salad premium ingredient , ever . I felt rip pot sticker , , consider I give enough feel satisfied . I 'm hop place fix aforementioned problem past two year . I come back , I plan time . On bright , summer evening , I fondly disappointed I sit burning hot car , reconsider life choice . Eating The Cheesecake Factory definitely regret . Eat risk !"
