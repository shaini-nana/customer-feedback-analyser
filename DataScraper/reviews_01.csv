superb excellent service and foods are very tasty
"Yesterday I visited the Rajagiriya outlet and ordered one Oyako don, one seafood curry rice, one Terriyaki chicken roll and a salmon firework roll
must say they've lost it as a whole, very disappointing,  the sushi roles were kind of ok, but the Oyako don was terrible as well, lacking flavour and it was kinda rice with some water boiled chicken! had to pour soy sause to get some taste over it! 
the seafood curry rice was the other let down! 
there were no more than three prawn pieces, i think one prawn was cut and used, and some tiny stingy pieces of calamari, no fish or crab though it said seafood,  also no seaweed as well! 
the better part is, potatoes were filled over! So guess why a person order a potato curry comming Shushi Bar
very disappointed and will never be visiting also will never be recommending anyone too, as a Japanes lover this was a massive let down"
